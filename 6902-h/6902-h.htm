    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      This exquisite novel, first published in 1859, like so many great works of
      art, holds depths of meaning which at first sight lie veiled under the
      simplicity and harmony of the technique. To the English reader <i>On the
      Eve</i> is a charmingly drawn picture of a quiet Russian household, with a
      delicate analysis of a young girl&rsquo;s soul; but to Russians it is also a
      deep and penetrating diagnosis of the destinies of the Russia of the
      fifties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena, the Russian girl, is the central figure of the novel. In comparing
      her with Turgenev&rsquo;s other women, the reader will remark that he is allowed
      to come into closer spiritual contact with her than even with Lisa. The
      successful portraits of women drawn by men in fiction are generally
      figures for the imagination to play on; however much that is told to one
      about them, the secret springs of their character are left a little
      obscure, but when Elena stands before us we know all the innermost secrets
      of her character. Her strength of will, her serious, courageous, proud
      soul, her capacity for passion, all the play of her delicate idealistic
      nature troubled by the contradictions, aspirations, and unhappiness that
      the dawn of love brings to her, all this is conveyed to us by the simplest
      and the most consummate art. The diary (chapter xvi.) that Elena keeps is
      in itself a masterly revelation of a young girl&rsquo;s heart; it has never been
      equalled by any other novelist. How exquisitely Turgenev reveals his
      characters may be seen by an examination of the parts Shubin the artist,
      and Bersenyev the student, play towards Elena. Both young men are in love
      with her, and the description of their after relations as friends, and the
      feelings of Elena towards them, and her own self-communings are interwoven
      with unfaltering skill. All the most complex and baffling shades of the
      mental life, which in the hands of many latter-day novelists build up
      characters far too thin and too unconvincing, in the hands of Turgenev are
      used with deftness and certainty to bring to light that great kingdom
      which is always lying hidden beneath the surface, beneath the common-place
      of daily life. In the difficult art of literary perspective, in the
      effective grouping of contrasts in character and the criss-cross of the
      influence of the different individuals, lies the secret of Turgenev&rsquo;s
      supremacy. As an example the reader may note how he is made to judge Elena
      through six pairs of eyes. Her father&rsquo;s contempt for his daughter, her
      mother&rsquo;s affectionate bewilderment, Shubin&rsquo;s petulant criticism,
      Bersenyev&rsquo;s half hearted enthralment, Insarov&rsquo;s recognition, and Zoya&rsquo;s
      indifference, being the facets for converging light on Elena&rsquo;s sincerity
      and depth of soul. Again one may note Turgenev&rsquo;s method for rehabilitating
      Shubin in our eyes; Shubin is simply made to criticise Stahov; the thing
      is done in a few seemingly careless lines, but these lines lay bare
      Shubin&rsquo;s strength and weakness, the fluidity of his nature. The reader who
      does not see the art which underlies almost every line of <i>On the Eve</i>
      is merely paying the highest tribute to that art; as often the clear
      waters of a pool conceal its surprising depth. Taking Shubin&rsquo;s character
      as an example of creative skill, we cannot call to mind any instance in
      the range of European fiction where the typical artist mind, on its
      lighter sides, has been analysed with such delicacy and truth as here by
      Turgenev. Hawthorne and others have treated it, but the colour seems to
      fade from their artist characters when a comparison is made between them
      and Shubin. And yet Turgenev&rsquo;s is but a sketch of an artist, compared
      with, let us say, the admirable figure of Roderick Hudson. The
      irresponsibility, alertness, the whimsicality and mobility of Shubin
      combine to charm and irritate the reader in the exact proportion that such
      a character affects him in actual life; there is not the least touch of
      exaggeration, and all the values are kept to a marvel. Looking at the
      minor characters, perhaps one may say that the husband, Stahov, will be
      the most suggestive, and not the least familiar character, to English
      households. His essentially masculine meanness, his self-complacency, his
      unconscious indifference to the opinion of others, his absurdity as &lsquo;<i>un
      pere de famille</i>&rsquo; is balanced by the foolish affection and jealousy
      which his wife, Anna Vassilyevna, cannot help feeling towards him. The
      perfect balance and duality of Turgenev&rsquo;s outlook is here shown by the
      equal cleverness with which he seizes on and quietly derides the typical
      masculine and typical feminine attitude in such a married life as the two
      Stahovs&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the figure of the Bulgarian hero, it is interesting to find
      from the <i>Souvenirs sur Tourguenev</i> (published in 1887) that
      Turgenev&rsquo;s only distinct failure of importance in character drawing,
      Insarov, was not taken from life, but was the legacy of a friend
      Karateieff, who implored Turgenev to work out an unfinished conception.
      Insarov is a figure of wood. He is so cleverly constructed, and the
      central idea behind him is so strong, that his wooden joints move
      naturally, and the spectator has only the instinct, not the certainty, of
      being cheated. The idea he incarnates, that of a man whose soul is aflame
      with patriotism, is finely suggested, but an idea, even a great one, does
      not make an individuality. And in fact Insarov is not a man, he is an
      automaton. To compare Shubin&rsquo;s utterances with his is to perceive that
      there is no spontaneity, no inevitability in Insarov. He is a patriotic
      clock wound up to go for the occasion, and in truth he is very useful.
      Only on his deathbed, when the unexpected happens, and the machinery runs
      down, do we feel moved. Then, he appears more striking dead than alive&mdash;a
      rather damning testimony to the power Turgenev credits him with. This
      artistic failure of Turgenev&rsquo;s is, as he no doubt recognised, curiously
      lessened by the fact that young girls of Elena&rsquo;s lofty idealistic type are
      particularly impressed by certain stiff types of men of action and great
      will-power, whose capacity for moving straight towards a certain goal by
      no means implies corresponding brain-power. The insight of a Shubin and
      the moral worth of a Bersenyev are not so valuable to the Elenas of this
      world, whose ardent desire to be made good use of, and to seek some great
      end, is best developed by strength of aim in the men they love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now to see what the novel before us means to the Russian mind, we must
      turn to the infinitely suggestive background. Turgenev&rsquo;s genius was of the
      same force in politics as in art; it was that of seeing aright. He saw his
      country as it was, with clearer eyes than any man before or since. If
      Tolstoi is a purer native expression of Russia&rsquo;s force, Turgenev is the
      personification of Russian aspiration working with the instruments of wide
      cosmopolitan culture. As a critic of his countrymen nothing escaped
      Turgenev&rsquo;s eye, as a politician he foretold nearly all that actually came
      to pass in his life, and as a consummate artist, led first and foremost by
      his love for his art, his novels are undying historical pictures. It is
      not that there is anything allegorical in his novels&mdash;allegory is at
      the furthest pole from his method: it is that whenever he created an
      important figure in fiction, that figure is necessarily a revelation of
      the secrets of the fatherland, the soil, the race. Turgenev, in short, was
      a psychologist not merely of men, but of nations; and so the chief figure
      of <i>On the Eve</i>, Elena, foreshadows and stands for the rise of young
      Russia in the sixties. Elena is young Russia, and to whom does she turn in
      her prayer for strength? Not to Bersenyev, the philosopher, the dreamer;
      not to Shubin, the man carried outside himself by every passing
      distraction; but to the strong man, Insarov. And here the irony of Insarov
      being made a foreigner, a Bulgarian, is significant of Turgenev&rsquo;s distrust
      of his country&rsquo;s weakness. The hidden meaning of the novel is a cry to the
      coming men to unite their strength against the foe without and the foe
      within the gates; it is an appeal to them not only to hasten the death of
      the old regime of Nicolas I, but an appeal to them to conquer their
      sluggishness, their weakness, and their apathy. It is a cry for Men.
      Turgenev sought in vain in life for a type of man to satisfy Russia, and
      ended by taking no living model for his hero, but the hearsay Insarov, a
      foreigner. Russia has not yet produced men of this type. But the artist
      does not despair of the future. Here we come upon one of the most striking
      figures of Turgenev&mdash;that of Uvar Ivanovitch. He symbolises the
      ever-predominant type of Russian, the sleepy, slothful Slav of to-day,
      yesterday, and to-morrow. He is the Slav whose inherent force Europe is as
      ignorant of as he is himself. Though he speaks only twenty sentences in
      the book he is a creation of Tolstoian force. His very words are dark and
      of practically no significance. There lies the irony of the portrait. The
      last words of the novel, the most biting surely that Turgenev ever wrote,
      contain the whole essence of <i>On the Eve</i>. On the Eve of What? one
      asks. Time has given contradictory answers to the men of all parties. The
      Elenas of to-day need not turn their eyes abroad to find their counterpart
      in spirit; so far at least the pessimists are refuted: but the note of
      death that Turgenev strikes in his marvellous chapter on Venice has still
      for young Russia an ominous echo&mdash;so many generations have arisen
      eager, only to be flung aside helpless, that one asks, what of the
      generation that fronts Autocracy to-day?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember I asked you, &ldquo;Will there ever be men among us?&rdquo; and you
      answered, &ldquo;there will be. O primaeval force!&rdquo; And now from here in &ldquo;my
      poetic distance&rdquo;, I will ask you again, &ldquo;What do you say, Uvar Ivanovitch,
      will there be?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers, and fixed his enigmatical stare
      into the far distance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This creation of an universal national type, out of the flesh and blood of
      a fat taciturn country gentleman, brings us to see that Turgenev was not
      merely an artist, but that he was a poet using fiction as his medium. To
      this end it is instructive to compare Jane Austen, perhaps the greatest
      English exponent of the domestic novel, with the Russian master, and to
      note that, while as a novelist she emerges favourably from the comparison,
      she is absolutely wanting in his poetic insight. How petty and parochial
      appears her outlook in <i>Emma</i>, compared to the wide and unflinching
      gaze of Turgenev. She painted most admirably the English types she knew,
      and how well she knew them! but she failed to correlate them with the
      national life; and yet, while her men and women were acting and thinking,
      Trafalgar and Waterloo were being fought and won. But each of Turgenev&rsquo;s
      novels in some subtle way suggests that the people he introduces are
      playing their little part in a great national drama everywhere around us,
      invisible, yet audible through the clamour of voices near us. And so <i>On
      the Eve</i>, the work of a poet, has certain deep notes, which break
      through the harmonious tenor of the whole, and strangely and swiftly
      transfigure the quiet story, troubling us with a dawning consciousness of
      the march of mighty events. Suddenly a strange sense steals upon the
      reader that he is living in a perilous atmosphere, filling his heart with
      foreboding, and enveloping at length the characters themselves, all
      unconsciously awaiting disaster in the sunny woods and gardens of
      Kuntsovo. But not till the last chapters are reached does the English
      reader perceive that in recreating for him the mental atmosphere of a
      single educated Russian household, Turgenev has been casting before his
      eyes the faint shadow of the national drama which was indeed played,
      though left unfinished, on the Balkan battlefields of 1876-7. Briefly,
      Turgenev, in sketching the dawn of love in a young girl&rsquo;s soul, has
      managed faintly, but unmistakably, to make spring and flourish in our
      minds the ineradicable, though hidden, idea at the back of Slav thought&mdash;the
      unification of the Slav races. How doubly welcome that art should be which
      can lead us, the foreigners, thus straight to the heart of the national
      secrets of a great people, secrets which our own critics and diplomatists
      must necessarily misrepresent. Each of Turgenev&rsquo;s novels may be said to
      contain a light-bringing rejoinder to the old-fashioned criticism of the
      Muscovite, current up to the rise of the Russian novel, and still,
      unfortunately, lingering among us; but <i>On the Eve</i>, of all the
      novels, contains perhaps the most instructive political lesson England can
      learn. Europe has always had, and most assuredly England has been
      over-rich in those alarm-monger critics, watchdogs for ever baying at Slav
      cupidity, treachery, intrigue, and so on and so on. It is useful to have
      these well-meaning animals on the political premises, giving noisy tongue
      whenever the Slav stretches out his long arm and opens his drowsy eyes,
      but how rare it is to find a man who can teach us to interpret a nation&rsquo;s
      aspirations, to gauge its inner force, its aim, its inevitability.
      Turgenev gives us such clues. In the respectful, if slightly forced,
      silence that has been imposed by certain recent political events on the
      tribe of faithful watchdogs, it may be permitted to one to say, that
      whatever England&rsquo;s interest may be in relation to Russia&rsquo;s development, it
      is better for us to understand the force of Russian aims, before we
      measure our strength against it And a novel, such as On the Eve, though
      now nearly forty years old, and to the short-sighted out of date, reveals
      in a flash the attitude of the Slav towards his political destiny. His
      aspirations may have to slumber through policy or necessity; they may be
      distorted or misrepresented, or led astray by official action, but we
      confess that for us, <i>On the Eve</i> suggests the existence of a mighty
      lake, whose waters, dammed back for a while, are rising slowly, but are
      still some way from the brim. How long will it take to the overflow?
      Nobody knows; but when the long winter of Russia&rsquo;s dark internal policy
      shall be broken up, will the snows, melting on the mountains, stream
      south-west, inundating the Valley of the Danube? Or, as the national poet,
      Pushkin, has sung, will there be a pouring of many Slavonian rivulets into
      the Russian sea, a powerful attraction of the Slav races towards a common
      centre to create an era of peace and development within, whereby Russia
      may rise free and rejoicing to face her great destinies? Hard and bitter
      is the shaping of nations. Uvar Ivanovitch still fixes his enigmatical
      stare into the far distance.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      On one of the hottest days of the summer of 1853, in the shade of a tall
      lime-tree on the bank of the river Moskva, not far from Kuntsovo, two
      young men were lying on the grass. One, who looked about twenty-three,
      tall and swarthy, with a sharp and rather crooked nose, a high forehead,
      and a restrained smile on his wide mouth, was lying on his back and gazing
      meditatively into the distance, his small grey eyes half closed. The other
      was lying on his chest, his curly, fair head propped on his two hands; he,
      too, was looking away into the distance. He was three years older than his
      companion, but seemed much younger. His moustache was only just growing,
      and his chin was covered with a light curly down. There was something
      childishly pretty, something attractively delicate, in the small features
      of his fresh round face, in his soft brown eyes, lovely pouting lips, and
      little white hands. Everything about him was suggestive of the happy
      light-heartedness of perfect health and youth&mdash;the carelessness,
      conceit, self-indulgence, and charm of youth. He used his eyes, and smiled
      and leaned his head as boys do who know that people look at them
      admiringly. He wore a loose white coat, made like a blouse, a blue
      kerchief wrapped his slender throat, and a battered straw hat had been
      flung on the grass beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion seemed elderly in comparison with him; and no one would have
      supposed, from his angular figure, that he too was happy and enjoying
      himself. He lay in an awkward attitude; his large head&mdash;wide at the
      crown and narrower at the base&mdash;hung awkwardly on his long neck;
      awkwardness was expressed in the very pose of his hands, of his body,
      tightly clothed in a short black coat, and of his long legs with their
      knees raised, like the hind-legs of a grasshopper. For all that, it was
      impossible not to recognise that he was a man of good education; the whole
      of his clumsy person bore the stamp of good-breeding; and his face, plain
      and even a little ridiculous as it was, showed a kindly nature and a
      thoughtful habit. His name was Andrei Petrovitch Bersenyev; his companion,
      the fair-haired young man, was called Pavel Yakovlitch Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you lie on your face, like me?&rsquo; began Shubin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s ever so
      much nicer so; especially when you kick up your heels and clap them
      together&mdash;like this. You have the grass under your nose; when you&rsquo;re
      sick of staring at the landscape you can watch a fat beetle crawling on a
      blade of grass, or an ant fussing about. It&rsquo;s really much nicer. But
      you&rsquo;ve taken up a pseudo-classical pose, for all the world like a
      ballet-dancer, when she reclines upon a rock of paste-board. You should
      remember you have a perfect right to take a rest now. It&rsquo;s no joking
      matter to come out third! Take your ease, sir; give up all exertion, and
      rest your weary limbs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin delivered this speech through his nose in a half-lazy, half-joking
      voice (spoilt children speak so to friends of the house who bring them
      sweetmeats), and without waiting for an answer he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What strikes me most forcibly in the ants and beetles and other worthy
      insects is their astounding seriousness. They run to and fro with such a
      solemn air, as though their life were something of such importance! A man
      the lord of creation, the highest being, stares at them, if you please,
      and they pay no attention to him. Why, a gnat will even settle on the lord
      of creation&rsquo;s nose, and make use of him for food. It&rsquo;s most offensive.
      And, on the other hand, how is their life inferior to ours? And why
      shouldn&rsquo;t they take themselves seriously, if we are to be allowed to take
      ourselves seriously? There now, philosopher, solve that problem for me!
      Why don&rsquo;t you speak? Eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Bersenyev, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; repeated Shubin. &lsquo;Your friend lays his deepest thoughts before
      you, and you don&rsquo;t listen to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was admiring the view. Look how hot and bright those fields are in the
      sun.&rsquo; Bersenyev spoke with a slight lisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some fine colour laid on there,&rsquo; observed Shubin. &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s a
      good hand at it, that&rsquo;s the fact!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to be even more ecstatic over it than I. It&rsquo;s in your line:
      you&rsquo;re an artist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; it&rsquo;s not in my line,&rsquo; rejoined Shubin, putting his hat on the back of
      his head. &lsquo;Flesh is my line; my work&rsquo;s with flesh&mdash;modelling flesh,
      shoulders, legs, and arms, and here there&rsquo;s no form, no finish; it&rsquo;s all
      over the place.... Catch it if you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is beauty here, too,&rsquo; remarked Bersenyev.&mdash;&lsquo;By the way,
      have you finished your bas-relief?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy with the goat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang it! Hang it! Hang it!&rsquo; cried Shubin, drawling&mdash;&lsquo;I looked at the
      genuine old things, the antiques, and I smashed my rubbish to pieces. You
      point to nature, and say &ldquo;there&rsquo;s beauty here, too.&rdquo; Of course, there&rsquo;s
      beauty in everything, even in your nose there&rsquo;s beauty; but you can&rsquo;t try
      after all kinds of beauty. The ancients, they didn&rsquo;t try after it; beauty
      came down of itself upon their creations from somewhere or other&mdash;from
      heaven, I suppose. The whole world belonged to them; it&rsquo;s not for us to be
      so large in our reach; our arms are short. We drop our hook into one
      little pool, and keep watch over it. If we get a bite, so much the better,
      if not&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin put out his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, stop,&rsquo; said Bensenyev, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a paradox. If you have no sympathy
      for beauty, if you do not love beauty wherever you meet it, it will not
      come to you even in your art. If a beautiful view, if beautiful music does
      not touch your heart; I mean, if you are not sympathetic&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you are a confirmed sympathetic!&rsquo; broke in Shubin, laughing at the
      new title he had coined, while Bersenyev sank into thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my dear fellow,&rsquo; Shubin went on, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a clever person, a
      philosopher, third graduate of the Moscow University; it&rsquo;s dreadful
      arguing with you, especially for an ignoramus like me, but I tell you
      what; besides my art, the only beauty I love is in women... in girls, and
      even that&rsquo;s recently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned over on to his back and clasped his hands behind his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few instants passed by in silence. The hush of the noonday heat lay upon
      the drowsy, blazing fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speaking of women,&rsquo; Shubin began again, &lsquo;how is it no one looks after
      Stahov? Did you see him in Moscow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old fellow&rsquo;s gone clean off his head. He sits for whole days together
      at his Augustina Christianovna&rsquo;s, he&rsquo;s bored to death, but still he sits
      there. They gaze at one another so stupidly.... It&rsquo;s positively disgusting
      to see them. Man&rsquo;s a strange animal. A man with such a home; but no, he
      must have his Augustina Christianovna! I don&rsquo;t know anything more
      repulsive than her face, just like a duck&rsquo;s! The other day I modelled a
      caricature of her in the style of Dantan. It wasn&rsquo;t half bad. I will show
      it you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Elena Nikolaevna&rsquo;s bust?&rsquo; inquired Bersenyev, &lsquo;is it getting on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my dear boy, it&rsquo;s not getting on. That face is enough to drive one to
      despair. The lines are pure, severe, correct; one would think there would
      be no difficulty in catching a likeness. It&rsquo;s not as easy as one would
      think though. It&rsquo;s like a treasure in a fairy-tale&mdash;you can&rsquo;t get
      hold of it. Have you ever noticed how she listens? There&rsquo;s not a single
      feature different, but the whole expression of the eyes is constantly
      changing, and with that the whole face changes. What is a sculptor&mdash;and
      a poor one too&mdash;to do with such a face? She&rsquo;s a wonderful creature&mdash;a
      strange creature,&rsquo; he added after a brief pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; she is a wonderful girl,&rsquo; Bersenyev repeated after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she the daughter of Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov! And after that
      people talk about blood, about stock! The amusing part of it is that she
      really is his daughter, like him, as well as like her mother, Anna
      Vassilyevna. I respect Anna Vassilyevna from the depths of my heart, she&rsquo;s
      been awfully good to me; but she&rsquo;s no better than a hen. Where did Elena
      get that soul of hers? Who kindled that fire in her? There&rsquo;s another
      problem for you, philosopher!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as before, the &lsquo;philosopher&rsquo; made no reply. Bersenyev did not in
      general err on the side of talkativeness, and when he did speak, he
      expressed himself awkwardly, with hesitation, and unnecessary
      gesticulation. And at this time a kind of special stillness had fallen on
      his soul, a stillness akin to lassitude and melancholy. He had not long
      come from town after prolonged hard work, which had absorbed him for many
      hours every day. The inactivity, the softness and purity of the air, the
      consciousness of having attained his object, the whimsical and careless
      talk of his friend, and the image&mdash;so suddenly called up&mdash;of one
      dear to him, all these impressions different&mdash;yet at the same time in
      a way akin&mdash;were mingled in him into a single vague emotion, which at
      once soothed and excited him, and robbed him of his power. He was a very
      highly strung young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cool and peaceful under the lime-tree; the flies and bees seemed to
      hum more softly as they flitted within its circle of shade. The fresh fine
      grass, of purest emerald green, without a tinge of gold, did not quiver,
      the tall flower stalks stood motionless, as though enchanted. On the lower
      twigs of the lime-tree the little bunches of yellow flowers hung still as
      death. At every breath a sweet fragrance made its way to the very depths
      of the lungs, and eagerly the lungs inhaled it. Beyond the river in the
      distance, right up to the horizon, all was bright and glowing. At times a
      slight breeze passed over, breaking up the landscape and intensifying the
      brightness; a sunlit vapour hung over the fields. No sound came from the
      birds; they do not sing in the heat of noonday; but the grasshoppers were
      chirping everywhere, and it was pleasant as they sat in the cool and
      quietness, to hear that hot, eager sound of life; it disposed to slumber
      and inclined the heart to reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you noticed,&rsquo; began Bersenyev, eking out his words with
      gesticulations, &lsquo;what a strange feeling nature produces in us? Everything
      in nature is so complete, so defined, I mean to say, so content with
      itself, and we understand that and admire it, and at the same time, in me
      at least, it always excites a kind of restlessness, a kind of uneasiness,
      even melancholy. What is the meaning of it? Is it that in the face of
      nature we are more vividly conscious of all our incompleteness, our
      indefiniteness, or have we little of that content with which nature is
      satisfied, but something else&mdash;I mean to say, what we need, nature
      has not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; replied Shubin, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Andrei Petrovitch, what all that
      comes from. You describe the sensations of a solitary man, who is not
      living but only looking on in ecstasy. Why look on? Live, yourself, and
      you will be all right. However much you knock at nature&rsquo;s door, she will
      never answer you in comprehensible words, because she is dumb. She will
      utter a musical sound, or a moan, like a harp string, but don&rsquo;t expect a
      song from her. A living heart, now&mdash;that will give you your answer&mdash;especially
      a woman&rsquo;s heart. So, my dear fellow, I advise you to get yourself some one
      to share your heart, and all your distressing sensations will vanish at
      once. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we need,&rdquo; as you say. This agitation, and melancholy,
      all that, you know, is simply a hunger of a kind. Give the stomach some
      real food, and everything will be right directly. Take your place in the
      landscape, live in the body, my dear boy. And after all, what is nature?
      what&rsquo;s the use of it? Only hear the word, love&mdash;what an intense,
      glowing sound it has! Nature&mdash;what a cold, pedantic expression. And
      so&rsquo; (Shubin began humming), &lsquo;my greetings to Marya Petrovna! or rather,&rsquo; 
      he added, &lsquo;not Marya Petrovna, but it&rsquo;s all the same! <i>Voo me compreny</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev got up and stood with his chin leaning on his clasped hands.
      &lsquo;What is there to laugh at?&rsquo; he said, without looking at his companion,
      &lsquo;why should you scoff? Yes, you are right: love is a grand word, a grand
      feeling.... But what sort of love do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin too, got up. &lsquo;What sort? What you like, so long as it&rsquo;s there. I
      will confess to you that I don&rsquo;t believe in the existence of different
      kinds of love. If you are in love&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With your whole heart,&rsquo; put in Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, of course, that&rsquo;s an understood thing; the heart&rsquo;s not an apple;
      you can&rsquo;t divide it. If you&rsquo;re in love, you&rsquo;re justified. And I wasn&rsquo;t
      thinking of scoffing. My heart&rsquo;s as soft at this moment as if it had been
      melted.... I only wanted to explain why nature has the effect on us you
      spoke of. It&rsquo;s because she arouses in us a need for love, and is not
      capable of satisfying it. Nature is gently driving us to other living
      embraces, but we don&rsquo;t understand, and expect something from nature
      herself. Ah, Andrei, Andrei, this sun, this sky is beautiful, everything
      around us is beautiful, still you are sad; but if, at this instant, you
      were holding the hand of a woman you loved, if that hand and the whole
      woman were yours, if you were even seeing with her eyes, feeling not your
      own isolated emotion, but her emotion&mdash;nature would not make you
      melancholy or restless then, and you would not be observing nature&rsquo;s
      beauty; nature herself would be full of joy and praise; she would be
      re-echoing your hymn, because then you would have given her&mdash;dumb
      nature&mdash;speech!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin leaped on to his feet and walked twice up and down, but Bersenyev
      bent his head, and his face was overcast by a faint flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t altogether agree with you,&rsquo; he began: &lsquo;nature does not always
      urge us... towards love.&rsquo; (He could not at once pronounce the word.)
      &lsquo;Nature threatens us, too; she reminds us of dreadful... yes, insoluble
      mysteries. Is she not destined to swallow us up, is she not swallowing us
      up unceasingly? She holds life and death as well; and death speaks in her
      as loudly as life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In love, too, there is both life and death,&rsquo; interposed Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; Bersenyev went on: &lsquo;when I, for example, stand in the spring
      in the forest, in a green glade, when I can fancy the romantic notes of
      Oberon&rsquo;s fairy horn&rsquo; (Bersenyev was a little ashamed when he had spoken
      these words)&mdash;&lsquo;is that, too&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thirst for love, the thirst for happiness, nothing more!&rsquo; broke in
      Shubin. &lsquo;I, too, know those notes, I know the languor and the expectation
      which come upon the soul in the forest&rsquo;s shade, in its deep recesses, or
      at evening in the open fields when the sun sets and the river mist rises
      behind the bushes. But forest, and river, and fields, and sky, every cloud
      and every blade of grass sets me expecting, hoping for happiness, I feel
      the approach, I hear the voice of happiness calling in everything. &ldquo;God of
      my worship, bright and gay!&rdquo; That was how I tried to begin my sole poem;
      you must own it&rsquo;s a splendid first line, but I could never produce a
      second. Happiness! happiness! as long as life is not over, as long as we
      have the use of all our limbs, as long as we are going up, not down, hill!
      Damn it all!&rsquo; pursued Shubin with sudden vehemence, &lsquo;we are young, and
      neither fools nor monsters; we will conquer happiness for ourselves!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his curls, and turned a confident almost challenging glance
      upwards to the sky. Bersenyev raised his eyes and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there nothing higher than happiness?&rsquo; he commented softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what, for instance?&rsquo; asked Shubin, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, for instance, you and I are, as you say, young; we are good men, let
      us suppose; each of us desires happiness for himself.... But is that word,
      happiness, one that could unite us, set us both on fire, and make us clasp
      each other&rsquo;s hands? Isn&rsquo;t that word an egoistic one; I mean, isn&rsquo;t it a
      source of disunion?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know words, then, that unite men?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and they are not few in number; and you know them, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? What words?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, even Art&mdash;since you are an artist&mdash;Country, Science,
      Freedom, Justice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what of love?&rsquo; asked Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Love, too, is a word that unites; but not the love you are eager for now;
      the love which is not enjoyment, the love which is self-sacrifice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very well for Germans; I want to love for myself; I want to be
      first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be first,&rsquo; repeated Bersenyev. &lsquo;But it seems to me that to put
      one&rsquo;s-self in the second place is the whole significance of our life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If all men were to act as you advise,&rsquo; commented Shubin with a plaintive
      expression, &lsquo;none on earth would eat pine-apples; every one would be
      offering them to other people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s as much as to say, pine-apples are not necessary; but you need not
      be alarmed; there will always be plenty of people who like them enough to
      take the bread out of other men&rsquo;s mouths to get them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both friends were silent a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I met Insarov again the other day,&rsquo; began Bersenyev. &lsquo;I invited him to
      stay with me; I really must introduce him to you&mdash;and to the
      Stahovs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is Insarov? Ah, to be sure, isn&rsquo;t it that Servian or Bulgarian you
      were telling me about? The patriot? Now isn&rsquo;t it he who&rsquo;s at the bottom of
      all these philosophical ideas?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he an exceptional individual?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clever? Talented?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clever&mdash;talented&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not? Then, what is there remarkable in him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall see. But now I think it&rsquo;s time to be going. Anna Vassilyevna
      will be waiting for us, very likely. What&rsquo;s the time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three o&rsquo;clock. Let us go. How baking it is! This conversation has set all
      my blood aflame. There was a moment when you, too,... I am not an artist
      for nothing; I observe everything. Confess, you are interested in a
      woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin tried to get a look at Bersenyev&rsquo;s face, but he turned away and
      walked out of the lime-tree&rsquo;s shade. Shubin went after him, moving his
      little feet with easy grace. Bersenyev walked clumsily, with his shoulders
      high and his neck craned forward. Yet, he looked a man of finer breeding
      than Shubin; more of a gentleman, one might say, if that word had not been
      so vulgarised among us.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The young men went down to the river Moskva and walked along its bank.
      There was a breath of freshness from the water, and the soft plash of tiny
      waves caressed the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would have another bathe,&rsquo; said Shubin, &lsquo;only I&rsquo;m afraid of being late.
      Look at the river; it seems to beckon us. The ancient Greeks would have
      beheld a nymph in it. But we are not Greeks, O nymph! we are thick-skinned
      Scythians.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have <i>roussalkas</i>,&rsquo; observed Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get along with your <i>roussalkas!</i> What&rsquo;s the use to me&mdash;a
      sculptor&mdash;of those children of a cold, terror-stricken fancy, those
      shapes begotten in the stifling hut, in the dark of winter nights? I want
      light, space.... Good God, when shall I go to Italy? When&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Little Russia, I suppose you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For shame, Andrei Petrovitch, to reproach me for an act of unpremeditated
      folly, which I have repented bitterly enough without that. Oh, of course,
      I behaved like a fool; Anna Vassilyevna most kindly gave me the money for
      an expedition to Italy, and I went off to the Little Russians to eat
      dumplings and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me have the rest, please,&rsquo; interposed Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yet still, I will say, the money was not spent in vain. I saw there such
      types, especially of women.... Of course, I know; there is no salvation to
      be found outside of Italy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will go to Italy,&rsquo; said Bersenyev, without turning towards him, &lsquo;and
      will do nothing. You will always be pluming your wings and never take
      flight. We know you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stavasser has taken flight.... And he&rsquo;s not the only one. If I don&rsquo;t fly,
      it will prove that I&rsquo;m a sea penguin, and have no wings. I am stifled
      here, I want to be in Italy,&rsquo; pursued Shubin, &lsquo;there is sunshine, there is
      beauty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A young girl in a large straw hat, with a pink parasol on her shoulder,
      came into sight at that instant, in the little path along which the
      friends were walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what do I see? Even here, there is beauty&mdash;coming to meet us! A
      humble artist&rsquo;s compliments to the enchanting Zoya!&rsquo; Shubin cried at once,
      with a theatrical flourish of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl to whom this exclamation referred, stopped, threatening him
      with her finger, and, waiting for the two friends to come up to her, she
      said in a ringing voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is it, gentlemen, you don&rsquo;t come in to dinner? It is on the table.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do I hear?&rsquo; said Shubin, throwing his arms up. &lsquo;Can it be that you,
      bewitching Zoya, faced such heat to come and look for us? Dare I think
      that is the meaning of your words? Tell me, can it be so? Or no, do not
      utter that word; I shall die of regret on the spot&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, do leave off, Pavel Yakovlitch,&rsquo; replied the young girl with some
      annoyance. &lsquo;Why will you never talk to me seriously? I shall be angry,&rsquo; 
      she added with a little coquettish grimace, and she pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not be angry with me, ideal Zoya Nikitishna; you would not drive
      me to the dark depths of hopeless despair. And I can&rsquo;t talk to you
      seriously, because I&rsquo;m not a serious person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl shrugged her shoulders, and turned to Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, he&rsquo;s always like that; he treats me like a child; and I am
      eighteen. I am grown-up now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Lord!&rsquo; groaned Shubin, rolling his eyes upwards; and Bersenyev smiled
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stamped with her little foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pavel Yakovlitch, I shall be angry! <i>Helene</i> was coming with me,&rsquo; 
      she went on, &lsquo;but she stopped in the garden. The heat frightened her, but
      I am not afraid of the heat. Come along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved forward along the path, slightly swaying her slender figure at
      each step, and with a pretty black-mittened little hand pushing her long
      soft curls back from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends walked after her (Shubin first pressed his hands, without
      speaking, to his heart, and then flung them higher than his head), and in
      a few instants they came out in front of one of the numerous country
      villas with which Kuntsovo is surrounded. A small wooden house with a
      gable, painted a pink colour, stood in the middle of the garden, and
      seemed to be peeping out innocently from behind the green trees. Zoya was
      the first to open the gate; she ran into the garden, crying: &lsquo;I have
      brought the wanderers!&rsquo; A young girl, with a pale and expressive face,
      rose from a garden bench near the little path, and in the doorway of the
      house appeared a lady in a lilac silk dress, holding an embroidered
      cambric handkerchief over her head to screen it from the sun, and smiling
      with a weary and listless air.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna Stahov&mdash;her maiden name was Shubin&mdash;had been
      left, at seven years old, an orphan and heiress of a pretty considerable
      property. She had very rich and also very poor relations; the poor
      relations were on her father&rsquo;s, the rich on her mother&rsquo;s side; the latter
      including the senator Volgin and the Princes Tchikurasov. Prince Ardalion
      Tchikurasov, who had been appointed her guardian, placed her in the best
      Moscow boarding-school, and when she left school, took her into his own
      home. He kept open house, and gave balls in the winter. Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s
      future husband, Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov, captured her heart at one of
      these balls when she was arrayed in a charming rose-coloured gown, with a
      wreath of tiny roses. She had treasured that wreath all her life. Nikolai
      Artemyevitch Stahov was the son of a retired captain, who had been wounded
      in 1812, and had received a lucrative post in Petersburg. Nikolai
      Artemyevitch entered the School of Cadets at sixteen, and left to go into
      the Guards. He was a handsome, well-made fellow, and reckoned almost the
      most dashing beau at evening parties of the middling sort, which were
      those he frequented for the most part; he had not gained a footing in the
      best society. From his youth he had been absorbed by two ideals: to get
      into the Imperial adjutants, and to make a good marriage; the first ideal
      he soon discarded, but he clung all the more closely to the second, and it
      was with that object that he went every winter to Moscow. Nikolai
      Artemyevitch spoke French fairly, and passed for being a philosopher,
      because he was not a rake. Even while he was no more than an ensign, he
      was given to discussing, persistently, such questions as whether it is
      possible for a man to visit the whole of the globe in the course of his
      whole lifetime, whether it is possible for a man to know what is happening
      at the bottom of the sea; and he always maintained the view that these
      things were impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch was twenty-five years old when he &lsquo;hooked&rsquo; Anna
      Vassilyevna; he retired from the service and went into the country to
      manage the property. He was soon tired of country life, and as the
      peasants&rsquo; labour was all commuted for rent he could easily leave the
      estate; he settled in Moscow in his wife&rsquo;s house. In his youth he had
      played no games of any kind, but now he developed a passion for loto, and,
      when loto was prohibited, for whist. At home he was bored; he formed a
      connection with a widow of German extraction, and spent almost all his
      time with her. In the year 1853 he had not moved to Kuntsovo; he stopped
      at Moscow, ostensibly to take advantage of the mineral waters; in reality,
      he did not want to part from his widow. He did not, however, have much
      conversation with her, but argued more than ever as to whether one can
      foretell the weather and such questions. Some one had once called him a <i>frondeur</i>;
      he was greatly delighted with that name. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he thought, letting the
      corners of his mouth drop complacently and shaking his head, &lsquo;I am not
      easily satisfied; you won&rsquo;t take me in.&rsquo; Nikolai Artemyevitch&rsquo;s <i>frondeurism</i>
      consisted in saying, for instance, when he heard the word nerves: &lsquo;And
      what do you mean by nerves?&rsquo; or if some one alluded in his presence to the
      discoveries of astronomy, asking: &lsquo;And do you believe in astronomy?&rsquo; When
      he wanted to overwhelm his opponent completely, he said: &lsquo;All that is
      nothing but words.&rsquo; It must be admitted that to many persons remarks of
      that kind seemed (and still seem) irrefutable arguments. But Nikolai
      Artemyevitch never suspected that Augustina Christianovna, in letters to
      her cousin, Theodolina Peterzelius, called him <i>Mein Pinselchen</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch&rsquo;s wife, Anna Vassilyevna, was a thin, little woman
      with delicate features, and a tendency to be emotional and melancholy. At
      school, she had devoted herself to music and reading novels; afterwards
      she abandoned all that. She began to be absorbed in dress, and that, too,
      she gave up. She did, for a time, undertake her daughter&rsquo;s education, but
      she got tired of that too, and handed her over to a governess. She ended
      by spending her whole time in sentimental brooding and tender melancholy.
      The birth of Elena Nikolaevna had ruined her health, and she could never
      have another child. Nikolai Artemyevitch used to hint at this fact in
      justification of his intimacy with Augustina Christianovna. Her husband&rsquo;s
      infidelity wounded Anna Vassilyevna deeply; she had been specially hurt by
      his once giving his German woman, on the sly, a pair of grey horses out of
      her (Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s) own stable. She had never reproached him to his
      face, but she complained of him secretly to every one in the house in
      turn, even to her daughter. Anna Vassilyevna did not care for going out,
      she liked visitors to come and sit with her and talk to her; she collapsed
      at once when she was left alone. She had a very tender and loving heart;
      life had soon crushed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pavel Yakovlitch Shubin happened to be a distant cousin of hers. His
      father had been a government official in Moscow. His brothers had entered
      cadets&rsquo; corps; he was the youngest, his mother&rsquo;s darling, and of delicate
      constitution; he stopped at home. They intended him for the university,
      and strained every effort to keep him at the gymnasium. From his early
      years he began to show an inclination for sculpture. The ponderous
      senator, Volgin, saw a statuette of his one day at his aunt&rsquo;s&mdash;he was
      then sixteen&mdash;and declared that he intended to protect this youthful
      genius. The sudden death of Shubin&rsquo;s father very nearly effected a
      complete transformation in the young man&rsquo;s future. The senator, the patron
      of genius, made him a present of a bust of Homer in plaster, and did
      nothing more. But Anna Vassilyevna helped him with money, and at nineteen
      he scraped through into the university in the faculty of medicine. Pavel
      felt no inclination for medical science, but, as the university was then
      constituted, it was impossible for him to enter in any other faculty.
      Besides, he looked forward to studying anatomy. But he did not complete
      his anatomical studies; at the end of the first year, and before the
      examination, he left the university to devote himself exclusively to his
      vocation. He worked zealously, but by fits and starts; he used to stroll
      about the country round Moscow sketching and modelling portraits of
      peasant girls, and striking up acquaintance with all sorts of people,
      young and old, of high and low degree, Italian models and Russian artists.
      He would not hear of the Academy, and recognised no one as a teacher. He
      was possessed of unmistakeable talent; it began to be talked about in
      Moscow. His mother, who came of a good Parisian family, a kind-hearted and
      clever woman, had taught him French thoroughly and had toiled and thought
      for him day and night. She was proud of him, and when, while still young
      in years, she died of consumption, she entreated Anna Vassilyevna to take
      him under her care. He was at that time twenty-one. Anna Vassilyevna
      carried out her last wish; a small room in the lodge of the country villa
      was given up to him.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to dinner, come along,&rsquo; said the lady of the house in a plaintive
      voice, and they all went into the dining-room. &lsquo;Sit beside me, <i>Zoe</i>,&rsquo; 
      added Anna Vassilyevna, &lsquo;and you, Helene, take our guest; and you, <i>Paul</i>,
      please don&rsquo;t be naughty and tease <i>Zoe</i>. My head aches to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin again turned his eyes up to the ceiling; Zoe responded with a
      half-smile. This Zoe, or, to speak more precisely, Zoya Nikitishna
      Mueller, was a pretty, fair-haired, half-Russian German girl, with a
      little nose rather wide at the end, and tiny red lips. She sang Russian
      ballads fairly well and could play various pieces, both lively and
      sentimental, very correctly on the piano. She dressed with taste, but in a
      rather childish style, and even over-precisely. Anna Vassilyevna had taken
      her as a companion for her daughter, and she kept her almost constantly at
      her side. Elena did not complain of that; she was absolutely at a loss
      what to say to Zoya when she happened to be left alone with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner lasted rather a long time; Bersenyev talked with Elena about
      university life, and his own plans and hopes; Shubin listened without
      speaking, ate with an exaggerated show of greediness, and now and then
      threw comic glances of despair at Zoya, who responded always with the same
      phlegmatic smile. After dinner, Elena with Bersenyev and Shubin went into
      the garden; Zoya looked after them, and, with a slight shrug of her
      shoulders, sat down to the piano. Anna Vassilyevna began: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
      go for a walk, too?&rsquo; but, without waiting for a reply, she added: &lsquo;Play me
      something melancholy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>La derniere pensee de Weber</i>?&rsquo; suggested Zoya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, yes, Weber,&rsquo; replied Anna Vassilyevna. She sank into an easy chair,
      and the tears started on to her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Elena led the two friends to an arbour of acacias, with a
      little wooden table in the middle, and seats round. Shubin looked round,
      and, whispering &lsquo;Wait a minute!&rsquo; he ran off, skipping and hopping to his
      own room, brought back a piece of clay, and began modelling a bust of
      Zoya, shaking his head and muttering and laughing to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At his old tricks again,&rsquo; observed Elena, glancing at his work. She
      turned to Bersenyev, with whom she was continuing the conversation begun
      at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My old tricks!&rsquo; repeated Shubin. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a subject that&rsquo;s simply
      inexhaustible! To-day, particularly, she drove me out of all patience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; inquired Elena. &lsquo;One would think you were speaking of some
      spiteful, disagreeable old woman. She is a pretty young girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; Shubin broke in, &lsquo;she is pretty, very pretty; I am sure that
      no one who meets her could fail to think: that&rsquo;s some one I should like to&mdash;dance
      a polka with; I&rsquo;m sure, too, that she knows that, and is pleased.... Else,
      what&rsquo;s the meaning of those modest simpers, that discreet air? There, you
      know what I mean,&rsquo; he muttered between his teeth. &lsquo;But now you&rsquo;re absorbed
      in something else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And breaking up the bust of Zoya, Shubin set hastily to modelling and
      kneading the clay again with an air of vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is your wish to be a professor?&rsquo; said Elena to Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, squeezing his red hands between his knees. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my
      cherished dream. Of course I know very well how far I fall short of being&mdash;to
      be worthy of such a high&mdash;I mean that I am too little prepared, but I
      hope to get permission for a course of travel abroad; I shall pass three
      or four years in that way, if necessary, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, dropped his eyes, then quickly raising them again, he gave an
      embarrassed smile and smoothed his hair. When Bersenyev was talking to a
      woman, his words came out more slowly, and he lisped more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to be a professor of history?&rsquo; inquired Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, or of philosophy,&rsquo; he added, in a lower voice&mdash;&lsquo;if that is
      possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a perfect devil at philosophy already,&rsquo; observed Shubin, making deep
      lines in the clay with his nail. &lsquo;What does he want to go abroad for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will you be perfectly contented with such a position?&rsquo; asked Elena,
      leaning on her elbow and looking him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfectly, Elena Nikolaevna, perfectly. What could be a finer vocation?
      To follow, perhaps, in the steps of Timofay Nikolaevitch ... The very
      thought of such work fills me with delight and confusion ... yes,
      confusion... which comes from a sense of my own deficiency. My dear father
      consecrated me to this work... I shall never forget his last words.&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father died last winter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Elena Nikolaevna, in February.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They say,&rsquo; Elena went on, &lsquo;that he left a remarkable work in manuscript;
      is it true?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He was a wonderful man. You would have loved him, Elena Nikolaevna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I should. And what was the subject of the work?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To give you an idea of the subject of the work in few words, Elena
      Nikolaevna, would be somewhat difficult. My father was a learned man, a
      Schellingist; he used terms which were not always very clear&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch,&rsquo; interrupted Elena, &lsquo;excuse my ignorance, what does
      that mean, a Schellingist?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev smiled slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Schellingist means a follower of Schelling, a German philosopher; and
      what the philosophy of Schelling consists in&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch!&rsquo; cried Shubin suddenly, &lsquo;for mercy&rsquo;s sake! Surely you
      don&rsquo;t mean to give Elena Nikolaevna a lecture on Schelling? Have pity on
      her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a lecture at all,&rsquo; murmured Bersenyev, turning crimson. &lsquo;I meant&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why not a lecture?&rsquo; put in Elena. &lsquo;You and I are in need of lectures,
      Pavel Yakovlitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin stared at her, and suddenly burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you laughing at?&rsquo; she said coldly, and almost sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, don&rsquo;t be angry,&rsquo; he said, after a short pause. &lsquo;I am sorry. But
      really it&rsquo;s a strange taste, upon my word, to discuss philosophy in
      weather like this under these trees. Let us rather talk of nightingales
      and roses, youthful eyes and smiles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and of French novels, and of feminine frills and fal-lals,&rsquo; Elena
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fal-lals, too, of course,&rsquo; rejoined Shubin, &lsquo;if they&rsquo;re pretty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. But suppose we don&rsquo;t want to talk of frills? You are always
      boasting of being a free artist; why do you encroach on the freedom of
      others? And allow me to inquire, if that&rsquo;s your bent of mind, why do you
      attack Zoya? With her it would be peculiarly suitable to talk of frills
      and roses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin suddenly fired up, and rose from the garden seat. &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s it?&rsquo; 
      he began in a nervous voice. &lsquo;I understand your hint; you want to send me
      away to her, Elena Nikolaevna. In other words, I&rsquo;m not wanted here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought of sending you away from here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to say,&rsquo; Shubin continued passionately, &lsquo;that I am not worthy
      of other society, that I am her equal; that I am as vain, and silly and
      petty as that mawkish German girl? Is that it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena frowned. &lsquo;You did not always speak like that of her, Pavel
      Yakovlitch,&rsquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! reproaches! reproaches now!&rsquo; cried Shubin. &lsquo;Well, then I don&rsquo;t deny
      there was a moment&mdash;one moment precisely, when those fresh, vulgar
      cheeks of hers... But if I wanted to repay you with reproaches and remind
      you... Good-bye,&rsquo; he added suddenly, &lsquo;I feel I shall say something silly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a blow on the clay moulded into the shape of a head, he ran out
      of the arbour and went off to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a baby,&rsquo; said Elena, looking after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s an artist,&rsquo; observed Bersenyev with a quiet smile. &lsquo;All artists are
      like that. One must forgive them their caprices. That is their privilege.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Elena; &lsquo;but Pavel has not so far justified his claim to
      that privilege in any way. What has he done so far? Give me your arm, and
      let us go along the avenue. He was in our way. We were talking of your
      father&rsquo;s works.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev took Elena&rsquo;s arm in his, and walked beside her through the
      garden; but the conversation prematurely broken off was not renewed.
      Bersenyev began again unfolding his views on the vocation of a professor,
      and on his own future career. He walked slowly beside Elena, moving
      awkwardly, awkwardly holding her arm, sometimes jostling his shoulder
      against her, and not once looking at her; but his talk flowed more easily,
      even if not perfectly freely; he spoke simply and genuinely, and his eyes,
      as they strayed slowly over the trunks of the trees, the sand of the path
      and the grass, were bright with the quiet ardour of generous emotions,
      while in his soothed voice there was heard the delight of a man who feels
      that he is succeeding in expressing himself to one very dear to him. Elena
      listened to him very attentively, and turning half towards him, did not
      take her eyes off his face, which had grown a little paler&mdash;off his
      eyes, which were soft and affectionate, though they avoided meeting her
      eyes. Her soul expanded; and something tender, holy, and good seemed half
      sinking into her heart, half springing up within it.

    <p>
      Shubin did not leave his room before night. It was already quite dark; the
      moon&mdash;not yet at the full&mdash;stood high in the sky, the milky way
      shone white, and the stars spotted the heavens, when Bersenyev, after
      taking leave of Anna Vassilyevna, Elena, and Zoya, went up to his friend&rsquo;s
      door. He found it locked. He knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; sounded Shubin&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I,&rsquo; answered Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me in, Pavel; don&rsquo;t be sulky; aren&rsquo;t you ashamed of yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not sulky; I&rsquo;m asleep and dreaming about Zoya.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do stop that, please; you&rsquo;re not a baby. Let me in. I want to talk to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had talk enough with Elena?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come; let me in!&rsquo; Shubin responded by a pretended snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev shrugged his shoulders and turned homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was warm and seemed strangely still, as though everything were
      listening and expectant; and Bersenyev, enfolded in the still darkness,
      stopped involuntarily; and he, too, listened expectant. On the tree-tops
      near there was a faint stir, like the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s dress, awaking
      in him a feeling half-sweet, half-painful, a feeling almost of fright. He
      felt a tingling in his cheeks, his eyes were chill with momentary tears;
      he would have liked to move quite noiselessly, to steal along in secret. A
      cross gust of wind blew suddenly on him; he almost shuddered, and his
      heart stood still; a drowsy beetle fell off a twig and dropped with a thud
      on the path; Bersenyev uttered a subdued &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and again stopped. But he
      began to think of Elena, and all these passing sensations vanished at
      once; there remained only the reviving sense of the night freshness, of
      the walk by night; his whole soul was absorbed by the image of the young
      girl. Bersenyev walked with bent head, recalling her words, her questions.
      He fancied he heard the tramp of quick steps behind. He listened: some one
      was running, some one was overtaking him; he heard panting, and suddenly
      from a black circle of shadow cast by a huge tree Shubin sprang out before
      him, quite pale in the light of the moon, with no cap on his disordered
      curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad you came along this path,&rsquo; he said with an effort. &lsquo;I should
      not have slept all night, if I had not overtaken you. Give me your hand.
      Are you going home?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will see you home then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why have you come without a cap on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. I took off my neckerchief too. It is quite warm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends walked a few paces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was very stupid to-day, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; Shubin asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To speak frankly, you were. I couldn&rsquo;t make you out. I have never seen
      you like that before. And what were you angry about really? Such trifles!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; muttered Shubin. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s how you put it; but they were not trifles
      to me. You see,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;I ought to point out to you that I&mdash;that&mdash;you
      may think what you please of me&mdash;I&mdash;well there! I&rsquo;m in love with
      Elena.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You in love with Elena!&rsquo; repeated Bersenyev, standing still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; pursued Shubin with affected carelessness. &lsquo;Does that astonish you?
      I will tell you something else. Till this evening I still had hopes that
      she might come to love me in time. But to-day I have seen for certain that
      there is no hope for me. She is in love with some one else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one else? Whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom? You!&rsquo; cried Shubin, slapping Bersenyev on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You,&rsquo; repeated Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev stepped back a pace, and stood motionless. Shubin looked
      intently at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And does that astonish you? You are a modest youth. But she loves you.
      You can make your mind easy on that score.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What nonsense you talk!&rsquo; Bersenyev protested at last with an air of
      vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not nonsense. But why are we standing still? Let us go on. It&rsquo;s
      easier to talk as we walk. I have known her a long while, and I know her
      well. I cannot be mistaken. You are a man after her own heart. There was a
      time when she found me agreeable; but, in the first place, I am too
      frivolous a young man for her, while you are a serious person, you are a
      morally and physically well-regulated person, you&mdash;hush, I have not
      finished, you are a conscientiously disposed enthusiast, a genuine type of
      those devotees of science, of whom&mdash;no not of whom&mdash;whereof the
      middle class of Russian gentry are so justly proud! And, secondly, Elena
      caught me the other day kissing Zoya&rsquo;s arms!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Zoya&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Zoya&rsquo;s. What would you have? She has such fine shoulders.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shoulders?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well there, shoulders and arms, isn&rsquo;t it all the same? Elena caught me in
      this unconstrained proceeding after dinner, and before dinner I had been
      abusing Zoya in her hearing. Elena unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t understand how
      natural such contradictions are. Then you came on the scene, you have
      faith in&mdash;what the deuce is it you have faith in?... You blush and
      look confused, you discuss Schiller and Schelling (she&rsquo;s always on the
      look-out for remarkable men), and so you have won the day, and I, poor
      wretch, try to joke&mdash;and all the while&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin suddenly burst into tears, turned away, and dropping upon the
      ground clutched at his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pavel,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;what childishness this is! Really! what&rsquo;s the matter
      with you to-day? God knows what nonsense you have got into your head, and
      you are crying. Upon my word, I believe you must be putting it on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin lifted up his head. The tears shone bright on his cheeks in the
      moonlight, but there was a smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you may think what you please about me. I
      am even ready to agree with you that I&rsquo;m hysterical now, but, by God, I&rsquo;m
      in love with Elena, and Elena loves you. I promised, though, to see you
      home, and I will keep my promise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a night! silvery, dark, youthful! How sweet it must be to-night for
      men who are loved! How sweet for them not to sleep! Will you sleep, Andrei
      Petrovitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev made no answer, and quickened his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you hurrying to?&rsquo; Shubin went on. &lsquo;Trust my words, a night like
      this will never come again in your life, and at home, Schelling will keep.
      It&rsquo;s true he did you good service to-day; but you need not hurry for all
      that. Sing, if you can sing, sing louder than ever; if you can&rsquo;t sing,
      take off your hat, throw up your head, and smile to the stars. They are
      all looking at you, at you alone; the stars never do anything but look
      down upon lovers&mdash;that&rsquo;s why they are so charming. You are in love, I
      suppose, Andrei Petrovitch?... You don&rsquo;t answer me... why don&rsquo;t you
      answer?&rsquo; Shubin began again: &lsquo;Oh, if you feel happy, be quiet, be quiet! I
      chatter because I am a poor devil, unloved, I am a jester, an artist, a
      buffoon; but what unutterable ecstasy would I quaff in the night wind
      under the stars, if I knew that I were loved!... Bersenyev, are you
      happy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev was silent as before, and walked quickly along the smooth path.
      In front, between the trees, glimmered the lights of the little village in
      which he was staying; it consisted of about a dozen small villas for
      summer visitors. At the very beginning of the village, to the right of the
      road, a little shop stood under two spreading birch-trees; its windows
      were all closed already, but a wide patch of light fell fan-shaped from
      the open door upon the trodden grass, and was cast upwards on the trees,
      showing up sharply the whitish undersides of the thick growing leaves. A
      girl, who looked like a maid-servant, was standing in the shop with her
      back against the doorpost, bargaining with the shopkeeper; from beneath
      the red kerchief which she had wrapped round her head, and held with bare
      hand under her chin, could just be seen her round cheek and slender
      throat. The young men stepped into the patch of light; Shubin looked into
      the shop, stopped short, and cried &lsquo;Annushka!&rsquo; The girl turned round
      quickly. They saw a nice-looking, rather broad but fresh face, with merry
      brown eyes and black eyebrows. &lsquo;Annushka!&rsquo; repeated Shubin. The girl saw
      him, looked scared and shamefaced, and without finishing her purchases,
      she hurried down the steps, slipped quickly past, and, hardly looking
      round, went along the road to the left. The shopkeeper, a puffy man,
      unmoved by anything in the world, like all country shopkeepers gasped and
      gaped after her, while Shubin turned to Bersenyev with the words:
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s... you see... there&rsquo;s a family here I know... so at their house...
      you mustn&rsquo;t imagine&rsquo; ... and, without finishing his speech, he ran after
      the retreating girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better at least wipe your tears away,&rsquo; Bersenyev shouted after him,
      and he could not refrain from laughing. But when he got home, his face had
      not a mirthful expression; he laughed no longer. He had not for a single
      instant believed what Shubin had told him, but the words he had uttered
      had sunk deep into his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pavel was making a fool of me,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;... but she will love one
      day... whom will she love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In Bersenyev&rsquo;s room there was a piano, small, and by no means new, but of
      a soft and sweet tone, though not perfectly in tune. Bersenyev sat down to
      it, and began to strike some chords. Like all Russians of good birth, he
      had studied music in his childhood, and like almost all Russian gentlemen,
      he played very badly; but he loved music passionately. Strictly speaking,
      he did not love the art, the forms in which music is expressed (symphonies
      and sonatas, even operas wearied him), but he loved the poetry of music:
      he loved those vague and sweet, shapeless, and all-embracing emotions
      which are stirred in the soul by the combinations and successions of
      sounds. For more than an hour, he did not move from the piano, repeating
      many times the same chords, awkwardly picking out new ones, pausing and
      melting over the minor sevenths. His heart ached, and his eyes more than
      once filled with tears. He was not ashamed of them; he let them flow in
      the darkness. &lsquo;Pavel was right,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I feel it; this evening will
      not come again.&rsquo; At last he got up, lighted a candle, put on his
      dressing-gown, took down from the bookshelf the second volume of Raumer&rsquo;s
      <i>History of the Hohenstaufen</i>, and sighing twice, he set to work
      diligently to read it.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Elena had gone to her room, and sat down at the open window,
      her head resting on her hands. To spend about a quarter of an hour every
      evening at her bedroom window had become a habit with her. At this time
      she held converse with herself, and passed in review the preceding day.
      She had not long reached her twentieth year. She was tall, and had a pale
      and dark face, large grey eyes under arching brows, covered with tiny
      freckles, a perfectly regular forehead and nose, tightly compressed lips,
      and a rather sharp chin. Her hair, of a chestnut shade, fell low on her
      slender neck. In her whole personality, in the expression of her face,
      intent and a little timorous, in her clear but changing glance, in her
      smile, which was, as it were, intense, in her soft and uneven voice, there
      was something nervous, electric, something impulsive and hurried,
      something, in fact, which could never be attractive to every one, which
      even repelled some.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands were slender and rosy, with long fingers; her feet were slender;
      she walked swiftly, almost impetuously, her figure bent a little forward.
      She had grown up very strangely; first she idolised her father, then she
      became passionately devoted to her mother, and had grown cold to both of
      them, especially to her father. Of late years she had behaved to her
      mother as to a sick grandmother; while her father, who had been proud of
      her while she had been regarded as an exceptional child, had come to be
      afraid of her when she was grown up, and said of her that she was a sort
      of enthusiastic republican&mdash;no one could say where she got it from.
      Weakness revolted her, stupidity made her angry, and deceit she could
      never, never pardon. She was exacting beyond all bounds, even her prayers
      had more than once been mingled with reproaches. When once a person had
      lost her respect&mdash;and she passed judgment quickly, often too quickly&mdash;he
      ceased to exist for her. All impressions cut deeply into her heart; life
      was bitter earnest for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governess to whom Anna Vassilyevna had entrusted the finishing of her
      daughter&rsquo;s education&mdash;an education, we may remark in parenthesis,
      which had not even been begun by the languid lady&mdash;was a Russian, the
      daughter of a ruined official, educated at a government boarding school, a
      very emotional, soft-hearted, and deceitful creature; she was for ever
      falling in love, and ended in her fiftieth year (when Elena was seventeen)
      by marrying an officer of some sort, who deserted her without loss of
      time. This governess was very fond of literature, and wrote verses
      herself; she inspired Elena with a love of reading, but reading alone did
      not satisfy the girl; from childhood she thirsted for action, for active
      well-doing&mdash;the poor, the hungry, and the sick absorbed her thoughts,
      tormented her, and made her heart heavy; she used to dream of them, and to
      ply all her friends with questions about them; she gave alms carefully,
      with unconscious solemnity, almost with a thrill of emotion. All ill-used
      creatures, starved dogs, cats condemned to death, sparrows fallen out of
      the nest, even insects and reptiles found a champion and protector in
      Elena; she fed them herself, and felt no repugnance for them. Her mother
      did not interfere with her; but her father used to be very indignant with
      his daughter, for her&mdash;as he called it&mdash;vulgar soft-heartedness,
      and declared there was not room to move for the cats and dogs in the
      house. &lsquo;Lenotchka,&rsquo; he would shout to her, &lsquo;come quickly, here&rsquo;s a spider
      eating a fly; come and save the poor wretch!&rsquo; And Lenotchka, all
      excitement, would run up, set the fly free, and disentangle its legs.
      &lsquo;Well, now let it bite you a little, since you are so kind,&rsquo; her father
      would say ironically; but she did not hear him. At ten years old Elena
      made friends with a little beggar-girl, Katya, and used to go secretly to
      meet her in the garden, took her nice things to eat, and presented her
      with handkerchiefs and pennies; playthings Katya would not take. She would
      sit beside her on the dry earth among the bushes behind a thick growth of
      nettles; with a feeling of delicious humility she ate her stale bread and
      listened to her stories. Katya had an aunt, an ill-natured old woman, who
      often beat her; Katya hated her, and was always talking of how she would
      run away from her aunt and live in &lsquo;<i>God&rsquo;s full freedom</i>&rsquo;; with
      secret respect and awe Elena drank in these new unknown words, stared
      intently at Katya and everything about her&mdash;her quick black, almost
      animal eyes, her sun-burnt hands, her hoarse voice, even her ragged
      clothes&mdash;seemed to Elena at such times something particular and
      distinguished, almost holy. Elena went back home, and for long after
      dreamed of beggars and God&rsquo;s freedom; she would dream over plans of how
      she would cut herself a hazel stick, and put on a wallet and run away with
      Katya; how she would wander about the roads in a wreath of corn-flowers;
      she had seen Katya one day in just such a wreath. If, at such times, any
      one of her family came into the room, she would shun them and look shy.
      One day she ran out in the rain to meet Katya, and made her frock muddy;
      her father saw her, and called her a slut and a peasant-wench. She grew
      hot all over, and there was something of terror and rapture in her heart
      Katya often sang some half-brutal soldier&rsquo;s song. Elena learnt this song
      from her.... Anna Vassilyevna overheard her singing it, and was very
      indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did you pick up such horrors?&rsquo; she asked her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena only looked at her mother, and would not say a word; she felt that
      she would let them tear her to pieces sooner than betray her secret, and
      again there was a terror and sweetness in her heart. Her friendship with
      Katya, however, did not last long; the poor little girl fell sick of
      fever, and in a few days she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena was greatly distressed, and spent sleepless nights for long after
      she heard of Katya&rsquo;s death. The last words of the little beggar-girl were
      constantly ringing in her ears, and she fancied that she was being
      called....
    </p>
    <p>
      The years passed and passed; swiftly and noiselessly, like waters running
      under the snow, Elena&rsquo;s youth glided by, outwardly uneventful, inwardly in
      conflict and emotion. She had no friend; she did not get on with any one
      of all the girls who visited the Stahovs&rsquo; house. Her parents&rsquo; authority
      had never weighed heavily on Elena, and from her sixteenth year she became
      absolutely independent; she began to live a life of her own, but it was a
      life of solitude. Her soul glowed, and the fire died away again in
      solitude; she struggled like a bird in a cage, and cage there was none; no
      one oppressed her, no one restrained her, while she was torn, and fretted
      within. Sometimes she did not understand herself, was even frightened of
      herself. Everything that surrounded her seemed to her half-senseless,
      half-incomprehensible. &lsquo;How live without love? and there&rsquo;s no one to
      love!&rsquo; she thought; and she felt terror again at these thoughts, these
      sensations. At eighteen, she nearly died of malignant fever; her whole
      constitution&mdash;naturally healthy and vigorous&mdash;was seriously
      affected, and it was long before it could perfectly recover; the last
      traces of the illness disappeared at last, but Elena Nikolaevna&rsquo;s father
      was never tired of talking with some spitefulness of her &lsquo;nerves.&rsquo; 
      Sometimes she fancied that she wanted something which no one wanted, of
      which no one in all Russia dreamed. Then she would grow calmer, and even
      laugh at herself, and pass day after day unconcernedly; but suddenly some
      over-mastering, nameless force would surge up within her, and seem to
      clamour for an outlet. The storm passed over, and the wings of her soul
      drooped without flight; but these tempests of feeling cost her much.
      However she might strive not to betray what was passing within her, the
      suffering of the tormented spirit was expressed in her even external
      tranquillity, and her parents were often justified in shrugging their
      shoulders in astonishment, and failing to understand her &lsquo;queer ways.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day with which our story began, Elena did not leave the window till
      later than usual. She thought much of Bersenyev, and of her conversation
      with him. She liked him; she believed in the warmth of his feelings, and
      the purity of his aims. He had never before talked to her as on that
      evening. She recalled the expression of his timid eyes, his smiles&mdash;and
      she smiled herself and fell to musing, but not of him. She began to look
      out into the night from the open window. For a long time she gazed at the
      dark, low-hanging sky; then she got up, flung back her hair from her face
      with a shake of her head, and, herself not knowing why, she stretched out
      to it&mdash;to that sky&mdash;her bare chilled arms; then she dropped
      them, fell on her knees beside her bed, pressed her face into the pillow,
      and, in spite of all her efforts not to yield to the passion overwhelming
      her, she burst into strange, uncomprehending, burning tears.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day at twelve o&rsquo;clock, Bersenyev set off in a return coach to
      Moscow. He had to get some money from the post-office, to buy some books,
      and he wanted to seize the opportunity to see Insarov and have some
      conversation with him. The idea had occurred to Bersenyev, in the course
      of his last conversation with Shubin, to invite Insarov to stay with him
      at his country lodgings. But it was some time before he found him out;
      from his former lodging he had moved to another, which it was not easy to
      discover; it was in the court at the back of a squalid stone house, built
      in the Petersburg style, between Arbaty Road and Povarsky Street. In vain
      Bersenyev wandered from one dirty staircase to another, in vain he called
      first to a doorkeeper, then to a passer-by. Porters even in Petersburg try
      to avoid the eyes of visitors, and in Moscow much more so; no one answered
      Bersenyev&rsquo;s call; only an inquisitive tailor, in his shirt sleeves, with a
      skein of grey thread on his shoulder, thrust out from a high casement
      window a dirty, dull, unshorn face, with a blackened eye; and a black and
      hornless goat, clambering up on to a dung heap, turned round, bleated
      plaintively, and went on chewing the cud faster than before. A woman in an
      old cloak, and shoes trodden down at heel, took pity at last on Bersenyev
      and pointed out Insarov&rsquo;s lodging to him. Bersenyev found him at home. He
      had taken a room with the very tailor who had stared down so indifferently
      at the perplexity of a wandering stranger; a large, almost empty room,
      with dark green walls, three square windows, a tiny bedstead in one
      corner, a little leather sofa in another, and a huge cage hung up to the
      very ceiling; in this cage there had once lived a nightingale. Insarov
      came to meet Bersenyev directly he crossed the threshold, but he did not
      exclaim, &lsquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s you!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Good Heavens, what happy chance has brought
      you?&rsquo; He did not even say, &lsquo;How do you do?&rsquo; but simply pressed his hand
      and led him up to the solitary chair in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; he said, and he seated himself on the edge of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am, as you see, still in disorder,&rsquo; added Insarov, pointing to a pile
      of papers and books on the floor, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got settled in as I ought. I
      have not had time yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov spoke Russian perfectly correctly, pronouncing every word fully
      and purely; but his guttural though pleasant voice sounded somehow not
      Russian. Insarov&rsquo;s foreign extraction (he was a Bulgarian by birth) was
      still more clearly marked in his appearance; he was a young man of
      five-and-twenty, spare and sinewy, with a hollow chest and knotted
      fingers; he had sharp features, a hooked nose, blue-black hair, a low
      forehead, small, intent-looking, deep-set eyes, and bushy eyebrows; when
      he smiled, splendid white teeth gleamed for an instant between his thin,
      hard, over-defined lips. He was in a rather old but tidy coat, buttoned up
      to the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you leave your old lodging?&rsquo; Bersenyev asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is cheaper, and nearer to the university.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But now it&rsquo;s vacation.... And what could induce you to stay in the town
      in summer! You should have taken a country cottage if you were determined
      to move.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov made no reply to this remark, and offered Bersenyev a pipe,
      adding: &lsquo;Excuse me, I have no cigarettes or cigars.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev began smoking the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here have I,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;taken a little house near Kuntsovo, very cheap
      and very roomy. In fact there is a room to spare upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov again made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev drew at the pipe: &lsquo;I have even been thinking,&rsquo; he began again,
      blowing out the smoke in a thin cloud, &lsquo;that if any one could be found&mdash;you,
      for instance, I thought of&mdash;who would care, who would consent to
      establish himself there upstairs, how nice it would be! What do you think,
      Dmitri Nikanorovitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov turned his little eyes on him. &lsquo;You propose my staying in your
      country house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; I have a room to spare there upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thanks very much, Andrei Petrovitch; but I expect my means would not
      allow of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My means would not allow of my living in a country house. It&rsquo;s impossible
      for me to keep two lodgings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But of course I&rsquo;&mdash;Bersenyev was beginning, but he stopped short.
      &lsquo;You would have no extra expense in that way,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;Your lodging
      here would remain for you, let us suppose; but then everything there is
      very cheap; we could even arrange so as to dine, for instance, together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov said nothing. Bersenyev began to feel awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might at least pay me a visit sometime,&rsquo; he began, after a short
      pause. &lsquo;A few steps from me there&rsquo;s a family living with whom I want very
      much to make you acquainted. If only you knew, Insarov, what a marvellous
      girl there is there! There is an intimate friend of mine staying there
      too, a man of great talent; I am sure you would get on with him. [The
      Russian loves to be hospitable&mdash;of his friends if he can offer
      nothing else.] Really, you must come. And what would be better still, come
      and stay with me, do. We could work and read together.... I am busy, as
      you know, with history and philosophy. All that would interest you. I have
      a lot of books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov got up and walked about the room. &lsquo;Let me know,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;how
      much do you pay for your cottage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A hundred silver roubles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how many rooms are there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then one may reckon that one room costs twenty roubles?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, one may reckon so.... But really it&rsquo;s utterly unnecessary for me. It
      simply stands empty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps so; but listen,&rsquo; added Insarov, with a decided, but at the same
      time good-natured movement of his head: &lsquo;I can only take advantage of your
      offer if you agree to take the sum we have reckoned. Twenty roubles I am
      able to give, the more easily, since, as you say, I shall be economising
      there in other things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course; but really I am ashamed to take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Otherwise it&rsquo;s impossible, Andrei Petrovitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as you like; but what an obstinate fellow you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov again made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men made arrangements as to the day on which Insarov was to
      move. They called the landlord; at first he sent his daughter, a little
      girl of seven, with a large striped kerchief on her head; she listened
      attentively, almost with awe, to all Insarov said to her, and went away
      without speaking; after her, her mother, a woman far gone with child, made
      her appearance, also wearing a kerchief on her head, but a very diminutive
      one. Insarov informed her that he was going to stay at a cottage near
      Kuntsovo, but should keep on his lodging and leave all his things in their
      keeping; the tailor&rsquo;s wife too seemed scared and went away. At last the
      man himself came in: he seemed to understand everything from the first,
      and only said gloomily: &lsquo;Near Kuntsovo?&rsquo; then all at once he opened the
      door and shouted: &lsquo;Are you going to keep the lodgings then?&rsquo; Insarov
      reassured him. &lsquo;Well, one must know,&rsquo; repeated the tailor morosely, as he
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev returned home, well content with the success of his proposal.
      Insarov escorted him to the door with cordial good manners, not common in
      Russia; and, when he was left alone, carefully took off his coat, and set
      to work upon sorting his papers.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the evening of the same day, Anna Vassilyevna was sitting in her
      drawing-room and was on the verge of weeping. There were also in the room
      her husband and a certain Uvar Ivanovitch Stahov, a distant cousin of
      Nikolai Artemyevitch, a retired cornet of sixty years old, a man corpulent
      to the point of immobility, with sleepy yellowish eyes, and colourless
      thick lips in a puffy yellow face. Ever since he had retired, he had lived
      in Moscow on the interest of a small capital left him by a wife who came
      of a shopkeeper&rsquo;s family. He did nothing, and it is doubtful whether he
      thought of anything; if he did think, he kept his thoughts to himself.
      Once only in his life he had been thrown into a state of excitement and
      shown signs of animation, and that was when he read in the newspapers of a
      new instrument at the Universal Exhibition in London, the
      &lsquo;contro-bombardon,&rsquo; and became very anxious to order this instrument for
      himself, and even made inquiries as to where to send the money and through
      what office. Uvar Ivanovitch wore a loose snuff-coloured coat and a white
      neckcloth, used to eat often and much, and in moments of great perplexity,
      that is to say when it happened to him to express some opinion, he would
      flourish the fingers of his right hand meditatively in the air, with a
      convulsive spasm from the first finger to the little finger, and back from
      the little finger to the first finger, while he articulated with effort,
      &lsquo;to be sure... there ought to... in some sort of a way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch was sitting in an easy chair by the window, breathing
      heavily; Nikolai Artemyevitch was pacing with long strides up and down the
      room, his hands thrust into his pockets; his face expressed
      dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still at last and shook his head. &lsquo;Yes;&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;in our day
      young men were brought up differently. Young men did not permit themselves
      to be lacking in respect to their elders. And nowadays, I can only look on
      and wonder. Possibly, I am all wrong, and they are quite right; possibly.
      But still I have my own views of things; I was not born a fool. What do
      you think about it, Uvar Ivanovitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch could only look at him and work his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna, for instance,&rsquo; pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, &lsquo;Elena
      Nikolaevna I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand. I am not elevated enough for
      her. Her heart is so large that it embraces all nature down to the least
      spider or frog, everything in fact except her own father. Well, that&rsquo;s all
      very well; I know it, and I don&rsquo;t trouble myself about it. For that&rsquo;s
      nerves and education and lofty aspirations, and all that is not in my
      line. But Mr. Shubin... admitting he&rsquo;s a wonderful artist&mdash;quite
      exceptional&mdash;that, I don&rsquo;t dispute; to show want of respect to his
      elder, a man to whom, at any rate, one may say he is under great
      obligation; that I confess, <i>dans mon gros bon sens</i>, I cannot pass
      over. I am not exacting by nature, no, but there is a limit to
      everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna rang the bell in a tremor. A little page came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is it Pavel Yakovlitch does not come?&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;what does it mean;
      I call him, and he doesn&rsquo;t come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is the object, may I ask, of your wanting to send for him? I
      don&rsquo;t expect that at all, I don&rsquo;t wish it even!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the object, Nikolai Artemyevitch? He has disturbed you; very
      likely he has checked the progress of your cure. I want to have an
      explanation with him. I want to know how he has dared to annoy you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you again, that I do not ask that. And what can induce you ... <i>devant
      les domestiques</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna flushed a little. &lsquo;You need not say that, Nikolai
      Artemyevitch. I never... <i>devant les domestiques</i>... Fedushka, go and
      see you bring Pavel Yakovlitch here at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little page went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s absolutely unnecessary,&rsquo; muttered Nikolai Artemyevitch between
      his teeth, and he began again pacing up and down the room. &lsquo;I did not
      bring up the subject with that object.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heavens, Paul must apologise to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heavens, what are his apologies to me? And what do you mean by
      apologies? That&rsquo;s all words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he must be corrected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you can correct him yourself. He will listen to you sooner than to
      me. For my part I bear him no grudge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Nikolai Artemyevitch, you&rsquo;ve not been yourself ever since you
      arrived. You have even to my eyes grown thinner lately. I am afraid your
      treatment is doing you no good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The treatment is quite indispensable,&rsquo; observed Nikolai Artemyevitch, &lsquo;my
      liver is affected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Shubin came in. He looked tired. A slight almost ironical
      smile played on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You asked for me, Anna Vassilyevna?&rsquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, certainly I asked for you. Really, Paul, this is dreadful. I am very
      much displeased with you. How could you be wanting in respect to Nikolai
      Artemyevitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikolai Artemyevitch has complained of me to you?&rsquo; inquired Shubin, and
      with the same smile on his lips he looked at Stahov. The latter turned
      away, dropping his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he complains of you. I don&rsquo;t know what you have done amiss, but you
      ought to apologise at once, because his health is very much deranged just
      now, and indeed we all ought when we are young to treat our benefactors
      with respect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what logic!&rsquo; thought Shubin, and he turned to Stahov. &lsquo;I am ready to
      apologise to you, Nikolai Artemyevitch,&rsquo; he said with a polite half-bow,
      &lsquo;if I have really offended you in any way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not at all... with that idea,&rsquo; rejoined Nikolai Artemyevitch, still
      as before avoiding Shubin&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;However, I will readily forgive you,
      for, as you know, I am not an exacting person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that admits of no doubt!&rsquo; said Shubin. &lsquo;But allow me to be
      inquisitive; is Anna Vassilyevna aware precisely what constituted my
      offence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I know nothing,&rsquo; observed Anna Vassilyevna, craning forward her head
      expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Good Lord!&rsquo; exclaimed Nikolai Artemyevitch hurriedly, &lsquo;how often have I
      prayed and besought, how often have I said how I hate these scenes and
      explanations! When one&rsquo;s been away an age, and comes home hoping for rest&mdash;talk
      of the family circle, <i>interieur</i>, being a family man&mdash;and here
      one finds scenes and unpleasantnesses. There&rsquo;s not a minute of peace.
      One&rsquo;s positively driven to the club... or, or elsewhere. A man is alive,
      he has a physical side, and it has its claims, but here&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And without concluding his sentence Nikolai Artemyevitch went quickly out,
      slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna looked after him. &lsquo;To the club!&rsquo; she muttered bitterly:
      &lsquo;you are not going to the club, profligate? You&rsquo;ve no one at the club to
      give away my horses to&mdash;horses from my own stable&mdash;and the grey
      ones too! My favourite colour. Yes, yes, fickle-hearted man,&rsquo; she went on
      raising her voice, &lsquo;you are not going to the club, As for you, Paul,&rsquo; she
      pursued, getting up, &lsquo;I wonder you&rsquo;re not ashamed. I should have thought
      you would not be so childish. And now my head has begun to ache. Where is
      Zoya, do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think she&rsquo;s upstairs in her room. The wise little fox always hides in
      her hole when there&rsquo;s a storm in the air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, please, please!&rsquo; Anna Vassilyevna began searching about her.
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen my little glass of grated horse-radish? Paul, be so good
      as not to make me angry for the future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How make you angry, auntie? Give me your little hand to kiss. Your
      horse-radish I saw on the little table in the boudoir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Darya always leaves it about somewhere,&rsquo; said Anna Vassilyevna, and she
      walked away with a rustle of silk skirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin was about to follow her, but he stopped on hearing Uvar
      Ivanovitch&rsquo;s drawling voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would... have given it you... young puppy,&rsquo; the retired cornet brought
      out in gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin went up to him. &lsquo;And what have I done, then, most venerable Uvar
      Ivanovitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How! you are young, be respectful. Yes indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Respectful to whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom? You know whom. Ay, grin away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin crossed his arms on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you type of the choice element in drama,&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;you primeval
      force of the black earth, cornerstone of the social fabric!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch&rsquo;s fingers began to work. &lsquo;There, there, my boy, don&rsquo;t
      provoke me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; pursued Shubin, &lsquo;is a gentleman, not young to judge by
      appearances, but what blissful, child-like faith is still hidden in him!
      Respect! And do you know, you primitive creature, what Nikolai
      Artemyevitch was in a rage with me for? Why I spent the whole of this
      morning with him at his German woman&rsquo;s; we were singing the three of us&mdash;&ldquo;Do
      not leave me.&rdquo; You should have heard us&mdash;that would have moved you.
      We sang and sang, my dear sir&mdash;and well, I got bored; I could see
      something was wrong, there was an alarming tenderness in the air. And I
      began to tease them both. I was very successful. First she was angry with
      me, then with him; and then he got angry with her, and told her that he
      was never happy except at home, and he had a paradise there; and she told
      him he had no morals; and I murmured &ldquo;Ach!&rdquo; to her in German. He walked
      off and I stayed behind; he came here, to his paradise that&rsquo;s to say, and
      he was soon sick of paradise, so he set to grumbling. Well now, who do you
      consider was to blame?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, of course,&rsquo; replied Uvar Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin stared at him. &lsquo;May I venture to ask you, most reverend
      knight-errant,&rsquo; he began in an obsequious voice, &lsquo;these enigmatical words
      you have deigned to utter as the result of some exercise of your
      reflecting faculties, or under the influence of a momentary necessity to
      start the vibration in the air known as sound?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tempt me, I tell you,&rsquo; groaned Uvar Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin laughed and ran away. &lsquo;Hi,&rsquo; shouted Uvar Ivanovitch a quarter of an
      hour later, &lsquo;you there... a glass of spirits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little page brought the glass of spirits and some salt fish on a tray.
      Uvar Ivanovitch slowly took the glass from the tray and gazed a long while
      with intense attention at it, as though he could not quite understand what
      it was he had in his hand. Then he looked at the page and asked him,
      &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t his name Vaska?&rsquo; Then he assumed an air of resignation, drank off
      the spirit, munched the herring and was slowly proceeding to get his
      handkerchief out of his pocket. But the page had long ago carried off and
      put away the tray and the decanter, eaten up the remains of the herring
      and had time to go off to sleep, curled up in a great-coat of his
      master&rsquo;s, while Uvar Ivanovitch still continued to hold the handkerchief
      before him in his opened fingers, and with the same intense attention
      gazed now at the window, now at the floor and walls.

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shubin went back to his room in the lodge and was just opening a book,
      when Nikolai Artemyevitch&rsquo;s valet came cautiously into his room and handed
      him a small triangular note, sealed with a thick heraldic crest. &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; 
      he found in the note, &lsquo;that you as a man of honour will not allow yourself
      to hint by so much as a single word at a certain promissory note which was
      talked of this morning. You are acquainted with my position and my rules,
      the insignificance of the sum in itself and the other circumstances; there
      are, in fine, family secrets which must be respected, and family
      tranquillity is something so sacred that only <i>etres sans cour</i>
      (among whom I have no reason to reckon you) would repudiate it! Give this
      note back to me.&mdash;N. S.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin scribbled below in pencil: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t excite yourself, I&rsquo;m not quite a
      sneak yet,&rsquo; and gave the note back to the man, and again began upon the
      book. But it soon slipped out of his hands. He looked at the
      reddening-sky, at the two mighty young pines standing apart from the other
      trees, thought &lsquo;by day pines are bluish, but how magnificently green they
      are in the evening,&rsquo; and went out into the garden, in the secret hope of
      meeting Elena there. He was not mistaken. Before him on a path between the
      bushes he caught a glimpse of her dress. He went after her, and when he
      was abreast with her, remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look in my direction, I&rsquo;m not worth it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a cursory glance, smiled cursorily, and walked on further
      into the depths of the garden. Shubin went after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you not to look at me,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;and then I address you; flagrant
      contradiction. But what of that? it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve contradicted
      myself. I have just recollected that I have never begged your pardon as I
      ought for my stupid behaviour yesterday. You are not angry with me, Elena
      Nikolaevna, are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still and did not answer him at once&mdash;not because she was
      angry, but because her thoughts were far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she said at last, &lsquo;I am not in the least angry.&rsquo; Shubin bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an absorbed... and what an indifferent face!&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;Elena
      Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he continued, raising his voice, &lsquo;allow me to tell you a
      little anecdote. I had a friend, and this friend also had a friend, who at
      first conducted himself as befits a gentleman but afterwards took to
      drink. So one day early in the morning, my friend meets him in the street
      (and by that time, note, the acquaintance has been completely dropped)
      meets him and sees he is drunk. My friend went and turned his back on him.
      But he ran up and said, &ldquo;I would not be angry,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;if you refused
      to recognise me, but why should you turn your back on me? Perhaps I have
      been brought to this through grief. Peace to my ashes!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is that all?&rsquo; inquired Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. What are you hinting at? You told me just now not
      to look your way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and now I have told you that it&rsquo;s too bad to turn your back on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But did I?&rsquo; began Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena flushed slightly and held out her hand to Shubin. He pressed it
      warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you seem to have convicted me of a bad feeling,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;but
      your suspicion is unjust. I was not even thinking of Avoiding you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Granted, granted. But you must acknowledge that at that minute you had a
      thousand ideas in your head of which you would not confide one to me. Eh?
      I&rsquo;ve spoken the truth, I&rsquo;m quite sure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why is it? why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My ideas are not clear to myself,&rsquo; said Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s just the time for confiding them to some one else,&rsquo; put in
      Shubin. &lsquo;But I will tell you what it really is. You have a bad opinion of
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes you; you imagine that everything in me is half-humbug because I am an
      artist, that I am incapable not only of doing anything&mdash;in that you
      are very likely right&mdash;but even of any genuine deep feeling; you
      think that I am not capable even of weeping sincerely, that I&rsquo;m a gossip
      and a slanderer,&mdash;and all because I&rsquo;m an artist. What luckless,
      God-forsaken wretches we artists are after that! You, for instance, I am
      ready to adore, and you don&rsquo;t believe in my repentance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Pavel Yakovlitch, I believe in your repentance and I believe in your
      tears. But it seems to me that even your repentance amuses you&mdash;yes
      and your tears too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I see this is, as the doctors say, a hopeless case, <i>casus
      incurabilis</i>. There is nothing left but to bow the head and submit. And
      meanwhile, good Heavens, can it be true, can I possibly be absorbed in my
      own egoism when there is a soul like this living at my side? And to know
      that one will never penetrate into that soul, never will know why it
      grieves and why it rejoices, what is working within it, what it desires&mdash;whither
      it is going... Tell me,&rsquo; he said after a short silence, &lsquo;could you never
      under any circumstances love an artist?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked straight into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Pavel Yakovlitch; no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which was to be proved,&rsquo; said Shubin with comical dejection. &lsquo;After which
      I suppose it would be more seemly for me not to intrude on your solitary
      walk. A professor would ask you on what data you founded your answer no.
      I&rsquo;m not a professor though, but a baby according to your ideas; but one
      does not turn one&rsquo;s back on a baby, remember. Good-bye! Peace to my
      ashes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena was on the point of stopping him, but after a moment&rsquo;s thought she
      too said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin went out of the courtyard. At a short distance from the Stahov&rsquo;s
      house he was met by Bersenyev. He was walking with hurried steps, his head
      bent and his hat pushed back on his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch!&rsquo; cried Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, go on,&rsquo; continued Shubin, &lsquo;I only shouted, I won&rsquo;t detain you&mdash;and
      you&rsquo;d better slip straight into the garden&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find Elena there,
      I fancy she&rsquo;s waiting for you... she&rsquo;s waiting for some one anyway.... Do
      you understand the force of those words: she is waiting! And do you know,
      my dear boy, an astonishing circumstance? Imagine, it&rsquo;s two years now that
      I have been living in the same house with her, I&rsquo;m in love with her, and
      it&rsquo;s only just now, this minute, that I&rsquo;ve, not understood, but really
      seen her. I have seen her and I lifted up my hands in amazement. Don&rsquo;t
      look at me, please, with that sham sarcastic smile, which does not suit
      your sober features. Well, now, I suppose you want to remind me of
      Annushka. What of it? I don&rsquo;t deny it. Annushkas are on my poor level. And
      long life to all Annushkas and Zoyas and even Augustina Christianovnas!
      You go to Elena now, and I will make my way to&mdash;Annushka, you fancy?
      No, my dear fellow, worse than that; to Prince Tchikurasov. He is a
      Maecenas of a Kazan-Tartar stock, after the style of Volgin. Do you see
      this note of invitation, these letters, R.S.V.P.? Even in the country
      there&rsquo;s no peace for me. Addio!&rsquo; Bersenyev listened to Shubin&rsquo;s tirade in
      silence, looking as though he were just a little ashamed of him. Then he
      went into the courtyard of the Stahovs&rsquo; house. And Shubin did really go to
      Prince Tchikurasov, to whom with the most cordial air he began saying the
      most insulting things. The Maecenas of the Tartars of Kazan chuckled; the
      Maecenas&rsquo;s guests laughed, but no one felt merry, and every one was in a
      bad temper when the party broke up. So two gentlemen slightly acquainted
      may be seen when they meet on the Nevsky Prospect suddenly grinning at one
      another and pursing up their eyes and noses and cheeks, and then, directly
      they have passed one another, they resume their former indifferent, often
      cross, and generally sickly, expression.

    <p>
      Elena met Bersenyev cordially, though not in the garden, but the
      drawing-room, and at once, almost impatiently, renewed the conversation of
      the previous day. She was alone; Nikolai Artemyevitch had quietly slipped
      away. Anna Vassilyevna was lying down upstairs with a wet bandage on her
      head. Zoya was sitting by her, the folds of her skirt arranged precisely
      about her, and her little hands clasped on her knees. Uvar Ivanovitch was
      reposing in the attic on a wide and comfortable divan, known as a
      &lsquo;samo-son&rsquo; or &lsquo;dozer.&rsquo; Bersenyev again mentioned his father; he held his
      memory sacred. Let us, too, say a few words about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of eighty-two serfs, whom he set free before his death, an old
      Gottingen student, and disciple of the &lsquo;Illuminati,&rsquo; the author of a
      manuscript work on &lsquo;transformations or typifications of the spirit in the
      world&rsquo;&mdash;a work in which Schelling&rsquo;s philosophy, Swedenborgianism and
      republicanism were mingled in the most original fashion&mdash;Bersenyev&rsquo;s
      father brought him, while still a boy, to Moscow immediately after his
      mother&rsquo;s death, and at once himself undertook his education. He prepared
      himself for each lesson, exerted himself with extraordinary
      conscientiousness and absolute lack of success: he was a dreamer, a
      bookworm, and a mystic; he spoke in a dull, hesitating voice, used obscure
      and roundabout expressions, metaphorical by preference, and was shy even
      of his son, whom he loved passionately. It was not surprising that his son
      was simply bewildered at his lessons, and did not advance in the least.
      The old man (he was almost fifty, he had married late in life) surmised at
      last that things were not going quite right, and he placed his Andrei in a
      school. Andrei began to learn, but he was not removed from his father&rsquo;s
      supervision; his father visited him unceasingly, wearying the schoolmaster
      to death with his instructions and conversation; the teachers, too, were
      bored by his uninvited visits; he was for ever bringing them some, as they
      said, far-fetched books on education. Even the schoolboys were embarrassed
      at the sight of the old man&rsquo;s swarthy, pockmarked face, his lank figure,
      invariably clothed in a sort of scanty grey dresscoat. The boys did not
      suspect then that this grim, unsmiling old gentleman, with his crane-like
      gait and his long nose, was at heart troubling and yearning over each one
      of them almost as over his own son. He once conceived the idea of talking
      to them about Washington: &lsquo;My young nurslings,&rsquo; he began, but at the first
      sounds of his strange voice the young nurslings ran away. The good old
      Gottingen student did not lie on a bed of roses; he was for ever weighed
      down by the march of history, by questions and ideas of every kind. When
      young Bersenyev entered the university, his father used to drive with him
      to the lectures, but his health was already beginning to break up. The
      events of the year 1848 shook him to the foundation (it necessitated the
      re-writing of his whole book), and he died in the winter of 1853, before
      his son&rsquo;s time at the university was over, but he was able beforehand to
      congratulate him on his degree, and to consecrate him to the service of
      science. &lsquo;I pass on the torch to you,&rsquo; he said to him two hours before his
      death. &lsquo;I held it while I could; you, too, must not let the light grow dim
      before the end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev talked a long while to Elena of his father. The embarrassment he
      had felt in her presence disappeared, and his lisp was less marked. The
      conversation passed on to the university.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; Elena asked him, &lsquo;were there any remarkable men among your
      comrades?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev was again reminded of Shubin&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Elena Nikolaevna, to tell you the truth, there was not a single
      remarkable man among us. And, indeed, where are such to be found! There
      was, they say, a good time once in the Moscow university! But not now. Now
      it&rsquo;s a school, not a university. I was not happy with my comrades,&rsquo; he
      added, dropping his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not happy,&rsquo; murmured Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I ought,&rsquo; continued Bersenyev, &lsquo;to make an exception. I know one
      student&mdash;it&rsquo;s true he is not in the same faculty&mdash;he is
      certainly a remarkable man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo; Elena inquired with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Insarov Dmitri Nikanorovitch. He is a Bulgarian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a Russian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he is not a Russian,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why is he living in Moscow, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He came here to study. And do you know with what aim he is studying? He
      has a single idea: the liberation of his country. And his story is an
      exceptional one. His father was a fairly well-to-do merchant; he came from
      Tirnova. Tirnova is now a small town, but it was the capital of Bulgaria
      in the old days when Bulgaria was still an independent state. He traded
      with Sophia, and had relations with Russia; his sister, Insarov&rsquo;s aunt, is
      still living in Kiev, married to a senior history teacher in the gymnasium
      there. In 1835, that is to say eighteen years ago, a terrible crime was
      committed; Insarov&rsquo;s mother suddenly disappeared without leaving a trace
      behind; a week later she was found murdered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena shuddered. Bersenyev stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on, go on,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There were rumours that she had been outraged and murdered by a Turkish
      aga; her husband, Insarov&rsquo;s father, found out the truth, tried to avenge
      her, but only succeeded in wounding the aga with his poniard.... He was
      shot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shot, and without a trial?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Insarov was just eight years old at the time. He remained in the
      hands of neighbours. The sister heard of the fate of her brother&rsquo;s family,
      and wanted to take the nephew to live with her. They got him to Odessa,
      and from there to Kiev. At Kiev he lived twelve whole years. That&rsquo;s how it
      is he speaks Russian so well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He speaks Russian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as we do. When he was twenty (that was at the beginning of the year
      1848) he began to want to return to his country. He stayed in Sophia and
      Tirnova, and travelled through the length and breadth of Bulgaria,
      spending two years there, and learning his mother tongue over again. The
      Turkish Government persecuted him, and he was certainly exposed to great
      dangers during those two years; I once caught sight of a broad scar on his
      neck, from a wound, no doubt; but he does not like to talk about it. He is
      reserved, too, in his own way. I have tried to question him about
      everything, but I could get nothing out of him. He answers by
      generalities. He&rsquo;s awfully obstinate. He returned to Russia again in 1850,
      to Moscow, with the intention of educating himself thoroughly, getting
      intimate with Russians, and then when he leaves the university&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then?&rsquo; broke in Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What God wills. It&rsquo;s hard to forecast the future.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while Elena did not take her eyes off Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have greatly interested me by what you have told me,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;What
      is he like, this friend of yours; what did you call him, Insarov?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall I say? To my mind, he&rsquo;s good-looking. But you will see him for
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will bring him here to see you. He is coming to our little village the
      day after tomorrow, and is going to live with me in the same lodging.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really? But will he care to come to see us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think so. He will be delighted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He isn&rsquo;t proud, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not the least. That&rsquo;s to say, he is proud if you like, only not in the
      sense you mean. He will never, for instance, borrow money from any one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he poor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he isn&rsquo;t rich. When he went to Bulgaria he collected some relics
      left of his father&rsquo;s property, and his aunt helps him; but it all comes to
      very little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He must have a great deal of character,&rsquo; observed Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He is a man of iron. And at the same time you will see there is
      something childlike and frank, with all his concentration and even his
      reserve. It&rsquo;s true, his frankness is not our poor sort of frankness&mdash;the
      frankness of people who have absolutely nothing to conceal.... But there,
      I will bring him to see you; wait a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And isn&rsquo;t he shy?&rsquo; asked Elena again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he&rsquo;s not shy. It&rsquo;s only vain people who are shy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, are you vain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confused and made a vague gesture with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You excite my curiosity,&rsquo; pursued Elena. &lsquo;But tell me, has he not taken
      vengeance on that Turkish aga?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev smiled
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Revenge is only to be found in novels, Elena Nikolaevna; and, besides, in
      twelve years that aga may well be dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Insarov has never said anything, though, to you about it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did he go to Sophia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His father used to live there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena grew thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To liberate one&rsquo;s country!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It is terrible even to utter those
      words, they are so grand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Anna Vassilyevna came into the room, and the conversation
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev was stirred by strange emotions when he returned home that
      evening. He did not regret his plan of making Elena acquainted with
      Insarov, he felt the deep impression made on her by his account of the
      young Bulgarian very natural... had he not himself tried to deepen that
      impression! But a vague, unfathomable emotion lurked secretly in his
      heart; he was sad with a sadness that had nothing noble in it. This
      sadness did not prevent him, however, from setting to work on the <i>History
      of the Hohenstaufen</i>, and beginning to read it at the very page at
      which he had left off the evening before.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days later, Insarov in accordance with his promise arrived at
      Bersenyev&rsquo;s with his luggage. He had no servant; but without any
      assistance he put his room to rights, arranged the furniture, dusted and
      swept the floor. He had special trouble with the writing table, which
      would not fit into the recess in the wall assigned for it; but Insarov,
      with the silent persistence peculiar to him succeeded in getting his own
      way with it. When he had settled in, he asked Bersenyev to let him pay him
      ten roubles in advance, and arming himself with a thick stick, set off to
      inspect the country surrounding his new abode. He returned three hours
      later; and in response to Bersenyev&rsquo;s invitation to share his repast, he
      said that he would not refuse to dine with him that day, but that he had
      already spoken to the woman of the house, and would get her to send him up
      his meals for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; said Bersenyev, &lsquo;you will fare very badly; that old body
      can&rsquo;t cook a bit. Why don&rsquo;t you dine with me, we would go halves over the
      cost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My means don&rsquo;t allow me to dine as you do,&rsquo; Insarov replied with a
      tranquil smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in that smile which forbade further insistence;
      Bersenyev did not add a word. After dinner he proposed to Insarov that he
      should take him to the Stahovs; but he replied that he had intended to
      devote the evening to correspondence with his Bulgarians, and so he would
      ask him to put off the visit to the Stahovs till next day. Bersenyev was
      already familiar with Insarov&rsquo;s unbending will; but it was only now when
      he was under the same roof with him, that he fully realised at last that
      Insarov would never alter any decision, just in the same way as he would
      never fail to carry out a promise he had given; to Bersenyev&mdash;a
      Russian to his fingertips&mdash;this more than German exactitude seemed at
      first odd, and even rather ludicrous; but he soon got used to it, and
      ended by finding it&mdash;if not deserving of respect&mdash;at least very
      convenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second day after his arrival, Insarov got up at four o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, made a round of almost all Kuntsovo, bathed in the river, drank a
      glass of cold milk, and then set to work. And he had plenty of work to do;
      he was studying Russian history and law, and political economy,
      translating the Bulgarian ballads and chronicles, collecting materials on
      the Eastern Question, and compiling a Russian grammar for the use of
      Bulgarians, and a Bulgarian grammar for the use of Russians. Bersenyev
      went up to him and began to discuss Feuerbach. Insarov listened
      attentively, made few remarks, but to the point; it was clear from his
      observations that he was trying to arrive at a conclusion as to whether he
      need study Feuerbach, or whether he could get on without him. Bersenyev
      turned the conversation on to his pursuits, and asked him if he could not
      show him anything. Insarov read him his translation of two or three
      Bulgarian ballads, and was anxious to hear his opinion of them. Bersenyev
      thought the translation a faithful one, but not sufficiently spirited.
      Insarov paid close attention to his criticism. From the ballads Bersenyev
      passed on to the present position of Bulgaria, and then for the first time
      he noticed what a change came over Insarov at the mere mention of his
      country: not that his face flushed nor his voice grew louder&mdash;no! but
      at once a sense of force and intense onward striving was expressed in his
      whole personality, the lines of his mouth grew harder and less flexible,
      and a dull persistent fire glowed in the depths of his eyes. Insarov did
      not care to enlarge on his own travels in his country; but of Bulgaria in
      general he talked readily with any one. He talked at length of the Turks,
      of their oppression, of the sorrows and disasters of his countrymen, and
      of their hopes: concentrated meditation on a single ruling passion could
      be heard in every word he uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, well, there&rsquo;s no mistake about it,&rsquo; Bersenyev was reflecting
      meanwhile, &lsquo;that Turkish aga, I venture to think, has been punished for
      his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov had not had time to say all he wanted to say, when the door opened
      and Shubin made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came into the room with an almost exaggerated air of ease and
      good-humour; Bersenyev, who knew him well, could see at once that
      something had been jarring on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will introduce myself without ceremony,&rsquo; he began with a bright and
      open expression on his face. &lsquo;My name is Shubin; I&rsquo;m a friend of this
      young man here&rsquo; (he indicated Bersenyev). &lsquo;You are Mr. Insarov, of course,
      aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Insarov.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then give me your hand and let us be friends. I don&rsquo;t know if Bersenyev
      has talked to you about me, but he has told me a great deal about you. You
      are staying here? Capital! Don&rsquo;t be offended at my staring at you so. I&rsquo;m
      a sculptor by trade, and I foresee I shall in a little time be begging
      your permission to model your head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My head&rsquo;s at your service,&rsquo; said Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall we do to-day, eh?&rsquo; began Shubin, sitting down suddenly on a
      low chair, with his knees apart and his elbows propped on them. &lsquo;Andrei
      Petrovitch, has your honour any kind of plan for to-day? It&rsquo;s glorious
      weather; there&rsquo;s a scent of hay and dried strawberries as if one were
      drinking strawberry-tea for a cold. We ought to get up some kind of a
      spree. Let us show the new inhabitant of Kuntsov all its numerous
      beauties.&rsquo; (Something has certainly upset him, Bersenyev kept thinking to
      himself.) &lsquo;Well, why art thou silent, friend Horatio? Open your prophetic
      lips. Shall we go off on a spree, or not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how Insarov feels,&rsquo; observed Bersenyev. &lsquo;He is just getting
      to work, I fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin turned round on his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want to work?&rsquo; he inquired, in a somewhat condescending voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Insarov; &lsquo;to-day I could give up to walking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; commented Shubin. &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s delightful. Run along, my friend,
      Andrei Petrovitch, put a hat on your learned head, and let us go where our
      eyes lead us. Our eyes are young&mdash;they may lead us far. I know a very
      repulsive little restaurant, where they will give us a very beastly little
      dinner; but we shall be very jolly. Come along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later they were all three walking along the bank of the
      Moskva. Insarov had a rather queer cap with flaps, over which Shubin fell
      into not very spontaneous raptures. Insarov walked without haste, and
      looked about, breathing, talking, and smiling with the same tranquillity;
      he was giving this day up to pleasure, and enjoying it to the utmost.
      &lsquo;Just as well-behaved boys walk out on Sundays,&rsquo; Shubin whispered in
      Bersenyev&rsquo;s ear. Shubin himself played the fool a great deal, ran in
      front, threw himself into the attitudes of famous statues, and turned
      somersaults on the grass; Insarov&rsquo;s tranquillity did not exactly irritate
      him, but it spurred him on to playing antics. &lsquo;What a fidget you are,
      Frenchman!&rsquo; Bersenyev said twice to him. &lsquo;Yes, I am French, half French,&rsquo; 
      Shubin answered, &lsquo;and you hold the happy medium between jest and earnest,
      as a waiter once said to me.&rsquo; The young men turned away from the river and
      went along a deep and narrow ravine between two walls of tall golden rye;
      a bluish shadow was cast on them from the rye on one side; the flashing
      sunlight seemed to glide over the tops of the ears; the larks were
      singing, the quails were calling: on all sides was the brilliant green of
      the grass; a warm breeze stirred and lifted the leaves and shook the heads
      of the flowers. After prolonged wanderings, with rest and chat between
      (Shubin had even tried to play leap-frog with a toothless peasant they
      met, who did nothing but laugh, whatever the gentlemen might do to him),
      the young men reached the &lsquo;repulsive little&rsquo; restaurant: the waiter almost
      knocked each of them over, and did really provide them with a very bad
      dinner with a sort of Balkan wine, which did not, however, prevent them
      from being very jolly, as Shubin had foretold; he himself was the loudest
      and the least jolly. He drank to the health of the incomprehensible but
      great <i>Venelin</i>, the health of the Bulgarian king Kuma, Huma, or
      Hroma, who lived somewhere about the time of Adam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the ninth century,&rsquo; Insarov corrected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the ninth century?&rsquo; cried Shubin. &lsquo;Oh, how delightful!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev noticed that among all his pranks, and jests and gaiety, Shubin
      was constantly, as it were, examining Insarov; he was sounding him and was
      in inward excitement, but Insarov remained as before, calm and
      straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they returned home, changed their dress, and resolved to finish
      the day as they had begun it, by going that evening to the Stahovs. Shubin
      ran on before them to announce their arrival.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The conquering hero Insarov will be here directly!&rsquo; he shouted
      triumphantly, going into the Stahovs&rsquo; drawing-room, where there happened
      at the instant to be only Elena and Zoya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Wer</i>?&rsquo; inquired Zoya in German. When she was taken unawares she
      always used her native language. Elena drew herself up. Shubin looked at
      her with a playful smile on his lips. She felt annoyed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You heard,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;Mr. Insarov is coming here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;and I heard how you spoke of him. I am surprised
      at you, indeed. Mr. Insarov has not yet set foot in the house, and you
      already think fit to turn him into ridicule.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin was crestfallen at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are right, you are always right, Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he muttered; &lsquo;but
      I meant nothing, on my honour. We have been walking together with him the
      whole day, and he&rsquo;s a capital fellow, I assure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask your opinion about that,&rsquo; commented Elena, getting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Insarov a young man?&rsquo; asked Zoya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a hundred and forty-four,&rsquo; replied Shubin with an air of vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The page announced the arrival of the two friends. They came in. Bersenyev
      introduced Insarov. Elena asked them to sit down, and sat down herself,
      while Zoya went off upstairs; she had to inform Anna Vassilyevna of their
      arrival. A conversation was begun of a rather insignificant kind, like all
      first conversations. Shubin was silently watching from a corner, but there
      was nothing to watch. In Elena he detected signs of repressed annoyance
      against him&mdash;Shubin&mdash;and that was all. He looked at Bersenyev
      and at Insarov, and compared their faces from a sculptor&rsquo;s point of view.
      &lsquo;They are neither of them good-looking,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;the Bulgarian has a
      characteristic face&mdash;there now it&rsquo;s in a good light; the
      Great-Russian is better adapted for painting; there are no lines, there&rsquo;s
      expression. But, I dare say, one might fall in love with either of them.
      She is not in love yet, but she will fall in love with Bersenyev,&rsquo; he
      decided to himself. Anna Vassilyevna made her appearance in the
      drawing-room, and the conversation took the tone peculiar to summer villas&mdash;not
      the country-house tone but the peculiar summer visitor tone. It was a
      conversation diversified by plenty of subjects; but broken by short rather
      wearisome pauses every three minutes. In one of these pauses Anna
      Vassilyevna turned to Zoya. Shubin understood her silent hint, and drew a
      long face, while Zoya sat down to the piano, and played and sang all her
      pieces through. Uvar Ivanovitch showed himself for an instant in the
      doorway, but he beat a retreat, convulsively twitching his fingers. Then
      tea was served; and then the whole party went out into the garden.... It
      began to grow dark outside, and the guests took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov had really made less impression on Elena than she had expected,
      or, speaking more exactly, he had not made the impression she had
      expected. She liked his directness and unconstraint, and she liked his
      face; but the whole character of Insarov&mdash;with his calm firmness and
      everyday simplicity&mdash;did not somehow accord with the image formed in
      her brain by Bersenyev&rsquo;s account of him. Elena, though she did not herself
      suspect it, had anticipated something more fateful. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; she reflected,
      &lsquo;he spoke very little to-day, and I am myself to blame for it; I did not
      question him, we must have patience till next time... and his eyes are
      expressive, honest eyes.&rsquo; She felt that she had no disposition to humble
      herself before him, but rather to hold out her hand to him in friendly
      equality, and she was puzzled; this was not how she had fancied men, like
      Insarov, &lsquo;heroes.&rsquo; This last word reminded her of Shubin, and she grew hot
      and angry, as she lay in her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you like your new acquaintances?&rsquo; Bersenyev inquired of Insarov
      on their way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I liked them very much,&rsquo; answered Insarov, &lsquo;especially the daughter. She
      must be a nice girl. She is excitable, but in her it&rsquo;s a fine kind of
      excitability.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must go and see them a little oftener,&rsquo; observed Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I must,&rsquo; said Insarov; and he said nothing more all the way home. He
      at once shut himself up in his room, but his candle was burning long after
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev had had time to read a page of Raumer, when a handful of fine
      gravel came rattling on his window-pane. He could not help starting;
      opening the window he saw Shubin as white as a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What an irrepressible fellow you are, you night moth&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
      Bersenyev was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sh&mdash;&rsquo; Shubin cut him short; &lsquo;I have come to you in secret, as Max
      went to Agatha I absolutely must say a few words to you alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come into the room then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not necessary,&rsquo; replied Shubin, and he leaned his elbows on
      the window-sill, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s better fun like this, more as if we were in Spain.
      To begin with, I congratulate you, you&rsquo;re at a premium now. Your belauded,
      exceptional man has quite missed fire. That I&rsquo;ll guarantee. And to prove
      my impartiality, listen&mdash;here&rsquo;s the sum and substance of Mr. Insarov.
      No talents, none, no poetry, any amount of capacity for work, an immense
      memory, an intellect not deep nor varied, but sound and quick, dry as
      dust, and force, and even the gift of the gab when the talk&rsquo;s about his&mdash;between
      ourselves let it be said&mdash;tedious Bulgaria. What! do you say I am
      unjust? One remark more: you&rsquo;ll never come to Christian names with him,
      and none ever has been on such terms with him. I, of course, as an artist,
      am hateful to him; and I am proud of it. Dry as dust, dry as dust, but he
      can crush all of us to powder. He&rsquo;s devoted to his country&mdash;not like
      our empty patriots who fawn on the people; pour into us, they say, thou
      living water! But, of course, his problem is easier, more intelligible: he
      has only to drive the Turks out, a mighty task. But all these qualities,
      thank God, don&rsquo;t please women. There&rsquo;s no fascination, no charm about
      them, as there is about you and me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you bring me in?&rsquo; muttered Bersenyev. &lsquo;And you are wrong in all
      the rest; you are not in the least hateful to him, and with his own
      countrymen he is on Christian name terms&mdash;that I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a different matter! For them he&rsquo;s a hero; but, to make a
      confession, I have a very different idea of a hero; a hero ought not to be
      able to talk; a hero should roar like a bull, but when he butts with his
      horns, the walls shake. He ought not to know himself why he butts at
      things, but just to butt at them. But, perhaps, in our days heroes of a
      different stamp are needed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you so taken up with Insarov?&rsquo; asked Bersenyev. &lsquo;Can you have run
      here only to describe his character to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came here,&rsquo; began Shubin, &lsquo;because I was very miserable at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it! Don&rsquo;t you want to have a cry again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may laugh! I came here because I&rsquo;m at my wits&rsquo; end, because I am
      devoured by despair, anger, jealousy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jealousy? of whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of you and him and every one. I&rsquo;m tortured by the thought that if I had
      understood her sooner, if I had set to work cleverly&mdash;But what&rsquo;s the
      use of talking! It must end by my always laughing, playing the fool,
      turning things into ridicule as she says, and then setting to and
      strangling myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stuff, you won&rsquo;t strangle yourself,&rsquo; observed Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On such a night, of course not; but only let me live on till the autumn.
      On such a night people do die too, but only of happiness. Ah, happiness!
      Every shadow that stretches across the road from every tree seems
      whispering now: &ldquo;I know where there is happiness... shall I tell you?&rdquo; I
      would ask you to come for a walk, only now you&rsquo;re under the influence of
      prose. Go to sleep, and may your dreams be visited by mathematical
      figures! My heart is breaking. You, worthy gentlemen, see a man laughing,
      and that means to your notions he&rsquo;s all right; you can prove to him that
      he&rsquo;s humbugging himself, that&rsquo;s to say, he is not suffering.... God bless
      you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin abruptly left the window. &lsquo;Annu-shka!&rsquo; Bersenyev felt an impulse to
      shout after him, but he restrained himself; Shubin had really been white
      with emotion. Two minutes later, Bersenyev even caught the sound of
      sobbing; he got up and opened the window; everything was still, only
      somewhere in the distance some one&mdash;a passing peasant, probably&mdash;was
      humming &lsquo;The Plain of Mozdok.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the first fortnight of Insarov&rsquo;s stay in the Kuntsovo
      neighbourhood, he did not visit the Stahovs more than four or five times;
      Bersenyev went to see them every day. Elena was always pleased to see him,
      lively and interesting talk always sprang up between them, and yet he
      often went home with a gloomy face. Shubin scarcely showed himself; he was
      working with feverish energy at his art; he either stayed locked up in his
      room, from which he would emerge in a blouse, smeared all over with clay,
      or else he spent days in Moscow where he had a studio, to which models and
      Italian sculptors, his friends and teachers, used to come to see him.
      Elena did not once succeed in talking with Insarov, as she would have
      liked to do; in his absence she prepared questions to ask him about many
      things, but when he came she felt ashamed of her plans. Insarov&rsquo;s very
      tranquillity embarrassed her; it seemed to her that she had not the right
      to force him to speak out; and she resolved to wait; for all that, she
      felt that at every visit however trivial might be the words that passed
      between them, he attracted her more and more; but she never happened to be
      left alone with him&mdash;and to grow intimate with any one, one must have
      at least one conversation alone with him. She talked a great deal about
      him to Bersenyev. Bersenyev realised that Elena&rsquo;s imagination had been
      struck by Insarov, and was glad that his friend had not &lsquo;missed fire&rsquo; as
      Shubin had asserted. He told her cordially all he knew of him down to the
      minutest details (we often, when we want to please some one, bring our
      friends into our conversation, hardly ever suspecting that we are praising
      ourselves in that way), and only at times, when Elena&rsquo;s pale cheeks
      flushed a little and her eyes grew bright and wide, he felt a pang in his
      heart of that evil pain which he had felt before.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Bersenyev came to the Stahovs, not at the customary time, but at
      eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Elena came down to him in the parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fancy,&rsquo; he began with a constrained smile, &lsquo;our Insarov has disappeared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disappeared?&rsquo; said Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has disappeared. The day before yesterday he went off somewhere and
      nothing has been seen of him since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did not tell you where he was going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena sank into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has most likely gone to Moscow,&rsquo; she commented, trying to seem
      indifferent and at the same time wondering that she should try to seem
      indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rsquo; rejoined Bersenyev. &lsquo;He did not go alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With whom then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two people of some sort&mdash;his countrymen they must have been&mdash;came
      to him the day before yesterday, before dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bulgarians! what makes you think so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why as far as I could hear, they talked to him in some language I did not
      know, but Slavonic... You are always saying, Elena Nikolaevna, that
      there&rsquo;s so little mystery about Insarov; what could be more mysterious
      than this visit? Imagine, they came to him&mdash;and then there was
      shouting and quarrelling, and such savage, angry disputing.... And he
      shouted too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shouted too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He shouted at them. They seemed to be accusing each other. And if
      you could have had a peep at these visitors. They had swarthy, heavy faces
      with high cheek bones and hook noses, both about forty years old, shabbily
      dressed, hot and dusty, looking like workmen&mdash;not workmen, and not
      gentlemen&mdash;goodness knows what sort of people they were.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he went away with them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. He gave them something to eat and went off with them. The woman of
      the house told me they ate a whole huge pot of porridge between the two of
      them. They outdid one another, she said, and gobbled it up like wolves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena gave a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;all this will be explained into something very
      prosaic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it may! But you need not use that word. There is nothing prosaic
      about Insarov, though Shubin does maintain&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shubin!&rsquo; Elena broke in, shrugging her shoulders. &lsquo;But you must confess
      these two good men gobbling up porridge&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even Themistocles had his supper on the eve of Salamis,&rsquo; observed
      Bersenyev with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; but then there was a battle next day. Any way you will let me know
      when he comes back,&rsquo; said Elena, and she tried to change the subject, but
      the conversation made little progress. Zoya made her appearance and began
      walking about the room on tip-toe, giving them thereby to understand that
      Anna Vassilyevna was not yet awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of the same day a note from him was brought to Elena. &lsquo;He
      has come back,&rsquo; he wrote to her, &lsquo;sunburnt and dusty to his very eyebrows;
      but where and why he went I don&rsquo;t know; won&rsquo;t you find out?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you find out!&rsquo; Elena whispered, &lsquo;as though he talked to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, at two o&rsquo;clock, Elena was standing in the garden before a
      small kennel, where she was rearing two puppies. (A gardener had found
      them deserted under a hedge, and brought them to the young mistress, being
      told by the laundry-maids that she took pity on beasts of all sorts. He
      was not wrong in his reckoning. Elena had given him a quarter-rouble.) She
      looked into the kennel, assured herself that the puppies were alive and
      well, and that they had been provided with fresh straw, turned round, and
      almost uttered a cry; down an alley straight towards her was walking
      Insarov, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning,&rsquo; he said, coming up to her and taking off his cap. She
      noticed that he certainly had got much sunburnt during the last three
      days. &lsquo;I meant to have come here with Andrei Petrovitch, but he was rather
      slow in starting; so here I am without him. There is no one in your house;
      they are all asleep or out of doors, so I came on here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem to be apologising,&rsquo; replied Elena. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no need to do that.
      We are always very glad to see you. Let us sit here on the bench in the
      shade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself. Insarov sat down near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have not been at home these last days, I think?&rsquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;I went away. Did Andrei Petrovitch tell you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov looked at her, smiled, and began playing with his cap. When he
      smiled, his eyes blinked, and his lips puckered up, which gave him a very
      good-humoured appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch most likely told you too that I went away with some&mdash;unattractive
      people,&rsquo; he said, still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena was a little confused, but she felt at once that Insarov must always
      be told the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said decisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you think of me?&rsquo; he asked her suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena raised her eyes to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I thought that you always know what you&rsquo;re doing,
      and you are incapable of doing anything wrong.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;thanks for that. You see, Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he began, coming
      closer to her in a confidential way, &lsquo;there is a little family of our
      people here; among us there are men of little culture; but all are warmly
      devoted to the common cause. Unluckily, one can never get on without
      dissensions, and they all know me, and trust me; so they sent for me to
      settle a dispute. I went.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it far from here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went about fifty miles, to the Troitsky district. There, near the
      monastery, there are some of our people. At any rate, my trouble was not
      thrown away; I settled the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And had you much difficulty?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. One was obstinate through everything. He did not want to give back
      the money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? Was the dispute over money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and a small sum of money too. What did you suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you travelled over fifty miles for such trifling matters? Wasted
      three days?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are not trifling matters, Elena Nikolaevna, when my countrymen are
      involved. It would be wicked to refuse in such cases. I see here that you
      don&rsquo;t refuse help even to puppies, and I think well of you for it. And as
      for the time I have lost, that&rsquo;s no great harm; I will make it up later.
      Our time does not belong to us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom does it belong then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, to all who need us. I have told you all this on the spur of the
      moment, because I value your good opinion. I can fancy how Andrei
      Petrovitch must have made you wonder!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You value my good opinion,&rsquo; said Elena, in an undertone, &lsquo;why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you are a good young lady, not an aristocrat... that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A short silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri Nikanorovitch,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;do you know that this is the first
      time you have been so unreserved with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s that? I think I have always said everything I thought to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, this is the first time, and I am very glad, and I too want to be open
      with you. May I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov began to laugh and said: &lsquo;You may.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I warn you I am very inquisitive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch has told me a great deal of your life, of your youth. I
      know of one event, one awful event.... I know you travelled afterwards in
      your own country.... Don&rsquo;t answer me for goodness sake, if you think my
      question indiscreet, but I am fretted by one idea.... Tell me, did you
      meet that man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena caught her breath. She felt both shame and dismay at her own
      audacity. Insarov looked at her intently, slightly knitting his brows, and
      stroking his chin with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he began at last, and his voice was much lower than
      usual, which almost frightened Elena, &lsquo;I understand what man you are
      referring to. No, I did not meet him, and thank God I did not! I did not
      try to find him. I did not try to find him: not because I did not think I
      had a right to kill him&mdash;I would kill him with a very easy conscience&mdash;but
      because now is not the time for private revenge, when we are concerned
      with the general national vengeance&mdash;or no, that is not the right
      word&mdash;when we are concerned with the liberation of a people. The one
      would be a hindrance to the other. In its own time that, too, will come...
      that too will come,&rsquo; he repeated, and he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked at him from the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You love your country very dearly?&rsquo; she articulated timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That remains to be shown,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;When one of us dies for her,
      then one can say he loved his country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So that, if you were cut off all chance of returning to Bulgaria,&rsquo; 
      continued Elena, &lsquo;would you be very unhappy in Russia?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I could not bear that,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; Elena began again, &lsquo;is it difficult to learn Bulgarian?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. It&rsquo;s a disgrace to a Russian not to know Bulgarian. A Russian
      ought to know all the Slavonic dialects. Would you like me to bring you
      some Bulgarian books? You will see how easy it is. What ballads we have!
      equal to the Servian. But stop a minute, I will translate to you one of
      them. It is about... But you know a little of our history at least, don&rsquo;t
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I know nothing of it,&rsquo; answered
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little and I will bring you a book. You will learn the principal
      facts at least from it. Listen to the ballad then.... But I had better
      bring you a written translation, though. I am sure you will love us, you
      love all the oppressed. If you knew what a land of plenty ours is! And,
      meanwhile, it has been downtrodden, it has been ravaged,&rsquo; he went on, with
      an involuntary movement of his arm, and his face darkened; &lsquo;we have been
      robbed of everything; everything, our churches, our laws, our lands; the
      unclean Turks drive us like cattle, butcher us&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri Nikanorovitch!&rsquo; cried Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon. I can&rsquo;t speak of this coolly. But you asked me just
      now whether I love my country. What else can one love on earth? What is
      the one thing unchanging, what is above all doubts, what is it&mdash;next
      to God&mdash;one must believe in? And when that country needs. ... Think;
      the poorest peasant, the poorest beggar in Bulgaria, and I have the same
      desire. All of us have one aim. You can understand what strength, what
      confidence that gives!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov was silent for an instant; then he began again to talk of
      Bulgaria. Elena listened to him with absorbed, profound, and mournful
      attention. When he had finished, she asked him once more:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you would not stay in Russia for anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he went away, for a long time she gazed after him. On that day he
      had become a different man for her. When she walked back with him through
      the garden, he was no longer the man she had met two hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day he began to come more and more often, and Bersenyev less and
      less often. A strange feeling began to grow up between the two friends, of
      which they were both conscious, but to which they could not give a name,
      and which they feared to analyse. In this way a month passed.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna, as the reader knows already, liked staying at home; but
      at times she manifested, quite unexpectedly, an irresistible longing for
      something out of the common, some extraordinary <i>partie du plaisir</i>,
      and the more troublesome the <i>partie du plaisir</i> was, the more
      preparations and arrangements it required, and the greater Anna
      Vassilyevna&rsquo;s own agitation over it, the more pleasure it gave her. If
      this mood came upon her in winter, she would order two or three boxes to
      be taken side by side, and, inviting all her acquaintances, would set off
      to the theatre or even to a masquerade; in summer she would drive for a
      trip out of town to some spot as far off as possible. The next day she
      would complain of a headache, groan and keep her bed; but within two
      months the same craving for something &lsquo;out of the common&rsquo; would break out
      in her again. That was just what happened now. Some one chanced to refer
      to the beautiful scenery of Tsaritsino before her, and Anna Vassilyevna
      suddenly announced an intention of driving to Tsaritsino the day after
      tomorrow. The household was thrown into a state of bustle; a messenger
      galloped off to Moscow for Nikolai Artemyevitch; with him galloped the
      butler to buy wines, pies, and all sorts of provisions; Shubin was
      commissioned to hire an open carriage&mdash;the coach alone was not enough&mdash;and
      to order relays of horses to be ready; a page was twice despatched to
      Bersenyev and Insarov with two different notes of invitation, written by
      Zoya, the first in Russian, the second in French; Anna Vassilyevna herself
      was busy over the dresses of the young ladies for the expedition.
      Meanwhile the <i>partie du plaisir</i> was very near coming to grief.
      Nikolai Artemyevitch arrived from Moscow in a sour, ill-natured, <i>frondeurish</i>
      frame of mind. He was still sulky with Augustina Christianovna; and when
      he heard what the plan was, he flatly declared that he would not go; that
      to go trotting from Kuntsovo to Moscow and from Moscow to Tsaritsino, and
      then from Tsaritsino again to Moscow, from Moscow again to Kuntsovo, was a
      piece of folly; and, &lsquo;in fact,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;let them first prove to my
      satisfaction, that one can be merrier on one spot of the globe than
      another spot, and I will go.&rsquo; This, of course, no one could prove to his
      satisfaction, and Anna Vassilyevna was ready to throw up the <i>partie du
      plaisir</i> for lack of a solid escort; but she recollected Uvar
      Ivanovitch, and in her distress she sent to his room for him, saying: &lsquo;a
      drowning man catches at straws.&rsquo; They waked him up; he came down, listened
      in silence to Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s proposition, and, to the general
      astonishment, with a flourish of his fingers, he consented to go. Anna
      Vassilyevna kissed him on the cheek, and called him a darling; Nikolai
      Artemyevitch smiled contemptuously and said: <i>quelle bourde!</i> (he
      liked on occasions to make use of a &lsquo;smart&rsquo; French word); and the
      following morning the coach and the open carriage, well-packed, rolled out
      of the Stahovs&rsquo; court-yard. In the coach were the ladies, a maid, and
      Bersenyev; Insarov was seated on the box; and in the open carriage were
      Uvar Ivanovitch and Shubin. Uvar Ivanovitch had himself beckoned Shubin to
      him; he knew that he would tease him the whole way, but there existed a
      queer sort of attachment, marked by abusive candour, between the &lsquo;primeval
      force&rsquo; and the young artist. On this occasion, however, Shubin left his
      fat friend in peace; he was absent-minded, silent, and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun stood high in a cloudless blue sky when the carriage drove up to
      the ruins of Tsaritsino Castle, which looked gloomy and menacing, even at
      mid-day. The whole party stepped out on to the grass, and at once made a
      move towards the garden. In front went Elena and Zoya with Insarov; Anna
      Vassilyevna, with an expression of perfect happiness on her face, walked
      behind them, leaning on the arm of Uvar Ivanovitch. He waddled along
      panting, his new straw hat cut his forehead, and his feet twinged in his
      boots, but he was content; Shubin and Bersenyev brought up the rear. &lsquo;We
      will form the reserve, my dear boy, like veterans,&rsquo; whispered Shubin to
      Bersenyev. &lsquo;Bulgaria&rsquo;s in it now!&rsquo; he added, indicating Elena with his
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was glorious. Everything around was flowering, humming,
      singing; in the distance shone the waters of the lakes; a light-hearted
      holiday mood took possession of all. &lsquo;Oh, how beautiful; oh, how
      beautiful!&rsquo; Anna Vassilyevna repeated incessantly; Uvar Ivanovitch kept
      nodding his head approvingly in response to her enthusiastic exclamations,
      and once even articulated: &lsquo;To be sure! to be sure!&rsquo; From time to time
      Elena exchanged a few words with Insarov; Zoya held the brim of her large
      hat with two fingers while her little feet, shod in light grey shoes with
      rounded toes, peeped coquettishly out from under her pink barege dress;
      she kept looking to each side and then behind her. &lsquo;Hey!&rsquo; cried Shubin
      suddenly in a low voice, &lsquo;Zoya Nikitishna is on the lookout, it seems. I
      will go to her. Elena Nikolaevna despises me now, while you, Andrei
      Petrovitch, she esteems, which comes to the same thing. I am going; I&rsquo;m
      tired of being glum. I should advise you, my dear fellow, to do some
      botanising; that&rsquo;s the best thing you could hit on in your position; it
      might be useful, too, from a scientific point of view. Farewell!&rsquo; Shubin
      ran up to Zoya, offered her his arm, and saying: &lsquo;<i>Ihre Hand, Madame</i>&rsquo; 
      caught hold of her hand, and pushed on ahead with her. Elena stopped,
      called to Bersenyev, and also took his arm, but continued talking to
      Insarov. She asked him the words for lily-of-the-valley, clover, oak,
      lime, and so on in his language... &lsquo;Bulgaria&rsquo;s in it!&rsquo; thought poor Andrei
      Petrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a shriek was heard in front; every one looked up. Shubin&rsquo;s
      cigar-case fell into a bush, flung by Zoya&rsquo;s hand. &lsquo;Wait a minute, I&rsquo;ll
      pay you out!&rsquo; he shouted, as he crept into the bushes; he found his
      cigar-case, and was returning to Zoya; but he had hardly reached her side
      when again his cigar-case was sent flying across the road. Five times this
      trick was repeated, he kept laughing and threatening her, but Zoya only
      smiled slyly and drew herself together, like a little cat. At last he
      snatched her fingers, and squeezed them so tightly that she shrieked, and
      for a long time afterwards breathed on her hand, pretending to be angry,
      while he murmured something in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mischievous things, young people,&rsquo; Anna Vassilyevna observed gaily to
      Uvar Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flourished his fingers in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a girl Zoya Nikitishna is!&rsquo; said Bersenyev to Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Shubin? What of him?&rsquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the whole party went into the arbour, well known as Pleasant
      View arbour, and stopped to admire the view of the Tsaritsino lakes. They
      stretched one behind the other for several miles, overshadowed by thick
      woods. The bright green grass, which covered the hill sloping down to the
      largest lake, gave the water itself an extraordinarily vivid emerald
      colour. Even at the water&rsquo;s edge not a ripple stirred the smooth surface.
      One might fancy it a solid mass of glass lying heavy and shining in a huge
      font; the sky seemed to drop into its depths, while the leafy trees gazed
      motionless into its transparent bosom. All were absorbed in long and
      silent admiration of the view; even Shubin was still; even Zoya was
      impressed. At last, all with one mind, began to wish to go upon the water.
      Shubin, Insarov, and Bersenyev raced each other over the grass. They
      succeeded in finding a large painted boat and two boatmen, and beckoned to
      the ladies. The ladies stepped into the boat; Uvar Ivanovitch cautiously
      lowered himself into it after them. Great was the mirth while he got in
      and took his seat. &lsquo;Look out, master, don&rsquo;t drown us,&rsquo; observed one of the
      boatmen, a snubnosed young fellow in a gay print shirt. &lsquo;Get along, you
      swell!&rsquo; said Uvar Ivanovitch. The boat pushed off. The young men took up
      the oars, but Insarov was the oniy one of them who could row. Shubin
      suggested that they should sing some Russian song in chorus, and struck
      up: &lsquo;Down the river Volga&rsquo;... Bersenyev, Zoya, and even Anna Vassilyevna,
      joined in&mdash;Insarov could not sing&mdash;but they did not keep
      together; at the third verse the singers were all wrong. Only Bersenyev
      tried to go on in the bass, &lsquo;Nothing on the waves is seen,&rsquo; but he, too,
      was soon in difficulties. The boatmen looked at one another and grinned in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Shubin, turning to them, &lsquo;the gentlefolks can&rsquo;t sing, you say?&rsquo; 
      The boy in the print shirt only shook his head. &lsquo;Wait a little snubnose,&rsquo; 
      retorted Shubin, &lsquo;we will show you. Zoya Nikitishna, sing us <i>Le lac</i>
      of Niedermeyer. Stop rowing!&rsquo; The wet oars stood still, lifted in the air
      like wings, and their splash died away with a tuneful drip; the boat
      drifted on a little, then stood still, rocking lightly on the water like a
      swan. Zoya affected to refuse at first.... &lsquo;<i>Allons</i>&rsquo; said Anna
      Vassilyevna genially.... Zoya took off her hat and began to sing: &lsquo;<i>O
      lac, l&rsquo;annee a peine a fini sa carriere</i>!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her small, but pure voice, seemed to dart over the surface of the lake;
      every word echoed far off in the woods; it sounded as though some one were
      singing there, too, in a distinct, but mysterious and unearthly voice.
      When Zoya finished, a loud bravo was heard from an arbour near the bank,
      from which emerged several red-faced Germans who were picnicking at
      Tsaritsino. Several of them had their coats off, their ties, and even
      their waistcoats; and they shouted &lsquo;<i>bis!</i>&rsquo; with such unmannerly
      insistence that Anna Vassilyevna told the boatmen to row as quickly as
      possible to the other end of the lake. But before the boat reached the
      bank, Uvar Ivanovitch once more succeeded in surprising his friends;
      having noticed that in one part of the wood the echo repeated every sound
      with peculiar distinctness, he suddenly began to call like a quail. At
      first every one was startled, but they listened directly with real
      pleasure, especially as Uvar Ivanovitch imitated the quail&rsquo;s cry with
      great correctness. Spurred on by this, he tried mewing like a cat; but
      this did not go off so well; and after one more quail-call, he looked at
      them all and stopped. Shubin threw himself on him to kiss him; he pushed
      him off. At that instant the boat touched the bank, and all the party got
      out and went on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the coachman, with the groom and the maid, had brought the
      baskets out of the coach, and made dinner ready on the grass under the old
      lime-trees. They sat down round the outspread tablecloth, and fell upon
      the pies and other dainties. They all had excellent appetites, while Anna
      Vassilyevna, with unflagging hospitality, kept urging the guests to eat
      more, assuring them that nothing was more wholesome than eating in the
      open air. She even encouraged Uvar Ivanovitch with such assurances. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      trouble about me!&rsquo; he grunted with his mouth full. &lsquo;Such a lovely day is a
      God-send, indeed!&rsquo; she repeated constantly. One would not have known her;
      she seemed fully twenty years younger. Bersenyev said as much to her.
      &lsquo;Yes, yes.&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I could hold my own with any one in my day.&rsquo; Shubin
      attached himself to Zoya, and kept pouring her out wine; she refused it,
      he pressed her, and finished by drinking the glass himself, and again
      pressing her to take another; he also declared that he longed to lay his
      head on her knee; she would on no account permit him &lsquo;such a liberty.&rsquo; 
      Elena seemed the most serious of the party, but in her heart there was a
      wonderful sense of peace, such as she had not known for long. She felt
      filled with boundless goodwill and kindness, and wanted to keep not only
      Insarov, but Bersenyev too, always at her side.... Andrei Petrovitch dimly
      understood what this meant, and secretly he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours flew by; the evening was coming on. Anna Vassilyevna suddenly
      took alarm. &lsquo;Ah, my dear friends, how late it is!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;All good
      things must have an end; it&rsquo;s time to go home.&rsquo; She began bustling about,
      and they all hastened to get up and walk towards the castle, where the
      carriages were. As they walked past the lakes, they stopped to admire
      Tsaritsino for the last time. The landscape on all sides was glowing with
      the vivid hues of early evening; the sky was red, the leaves were flashing
      with changing colours as they stirred in the rising wind; the distant
      waters shone in liquid gold; the reddish turrets and arbours scattered
      about the garden stood out sharply against the dark green of the trees.
      &lsquo;Farewell, Tsaritsino, we shall not forget to-day&rsquo;s excursion!&rsquo; observed
      Anna Vassilyevna.... But at that instant, and as though in confirmation of
      her words, a strange incident occurred, which certainly was not likely to
      be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what happened. Anna Vassilyevna had hardly sent her farewell
      greeting to Tsaritsino, when suddenly, a few paces from her, behind a high
      bush of lilac, were heard confused exclamations, shouts, and laughter; and
      a whole mob of disorderly men, the same devotees of song who had so
      energetically applauded Zoya, burst out on the path. These musical
      gentlemen seemed excessively elevated. They stopped at the sight of the
      ladies; but one of them, a man of immense height, with a bull neck and a
      bull&rsquo;s goggle eyes, separated from his companions, and, bowing clumsily
      and staggering unsteadily in his gait, approached Anna Vassilyevna, who
      was petrified with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Bonzhoor, madame</i>,&rsquo; he said thickly, &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna started back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t you,&rsquo; continued the giant in vile Russian, &lsquo;sing again when
      our party shouted <i>bis</i>, and bravo?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, why?&rsquo; came from the ranks of his comrades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov was about to step forward, but Shubin stopped him, and himself
      screened Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Allow me,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;honoured stranger, to express to you the heartfelt
      amazement, into which you have thrown all of us by your conduct. You
      belong, as far as I can judge, to the Saxon branch of the Caucasian race;
      consequently we are bound to assume your acquaintance with the customs of
      society, yet you address a lady to whom you have not been introduced. I
      assure you that I individually should be delighted another time to make
      your acquaintance, since I observe in you a phenomenal development of the
      muscles, biceps, triceps and deltoid, so that, as a sculptor, I should
      esteem it a genuine happiness to have you for a model; but on this
      occasion kindly leave us alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;honoured stranger&rsquo; listened to Shubin&rsquo;s speech, his head held
      contemptuously on one side and his arms akimbo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you say,&rsquo; he commented at last. &lsquo;Do you suppose
      I&rsquo;m a cobbler or a watchmaker? Hey! I&rsquo;m an officer, an official, so
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt that&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Shubin was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I say is,&rsquo; continued the stranger, putting him aside with his
      powerful arm, like a twig out of the path&mdash;&lsquo;why didn&rsquo;t you sing again
      when we shouted <i>bis</i>? And I&rsquo;ll go away directly, this minute, only I
      tell you what I want, this fraulein, not that madam, no, not her, but this
      one or that one (he pointed to Elena and Zoya) must give me <i>einen Kuss</i>,
      as we say in German, a kiss, in fact; eh? That&rsquo;s not much to ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Einen Kuss</i>, that&rsquo;s not much,&rsquo; came again from the ranks of his
      companions, &lsquo;<i>Ih! der Stakramenter!</i>&rsquo; cried one tipsy German,
      bursting with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoya clutched at Insarov&rsquo;s arm, but he broke away from her, and stood
      directly facing the insolent giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will please to move off,&rsquo; he said in a voice not loud but sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German gave a heavy laugh, &lsquo;Move off? Well, I like that. Can&rsquo;t I walk
      where I please? Move off? Why should I move off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you have dared to annoy a lady,&rsquo; said Insarov, and suddenly he
      turned white, &lsquo;because you&rsquo;re drunk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? me drunk? Hear what he says. <i>Horen Sie das, Herr Provisor</i>? I&rsquo;m
      an officer, and he dares... Now I demand <i>satisfaction</i>. <i>Einen
      Kuss will ich</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you come another step nearer&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; began Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well? What then&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll throw you in the water!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the water? <i>Herr Je</i>! Is that all? Well, let us see that, that
      would be very curious, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer lifted his fists and moved forward, but suddenly something
      extraordinary happened. He uttered an exclamation, his whole bulky person
      staggered, rose from the ground, his legs kicking in the air, and before
      the ladies had time to shriek, before any one had time to realise how it
      had happened, the officer&rsquo;s massive figure went plop with a heavy splash,
      and at once disappeared under the eddying water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; screamed the ladies with one voice. &lsquo;<i>Mein Gott</i>!&rsquo; was heard
      from the other side. An instant passed... and a round head, all plastered
      over with wet hair, showed above water, it was blowing bubbles, this head;
      and floundering with two hands just at its very lips. &lsquo;He will be drowned,
      save him! save him!&rsquo; cried Anna Vassilyevna to Insarov, who was standing
      with his legs apart on the bank, breathing heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will swim out,&rsquo; he answered with contemptuous and unsympathetic
      indifference. &lsquo;Let us go on,&rsquo; he added, taking Anna Vassilyevna by the
      arm. &lsquo;Come, Uvar Ivanovitch, Elena Nikolaevna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A&mdash;a&mdash;o&mdash;o&rsquo; was heard at that instant, the plaint of the
      hapless German who had managed to get hold of the rushes on the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all followed Insarov, and had to pass close by the party. But,
      deprived of their leader, the rowdies were subdued and did not utter a
      word; but one, the boldest of them, muttered, shaking his head menacingly:
      &lsquo;All right... we shall see though... after that&rsquo;; but one of the others
      even took his hat off. Insarov struck them as formidable, and rightly so;
      something evil, something dangerous could be seen in his face. The Germans
      hastened to pull out their comrade, who, directly he had his feet on dry
      ground, broke into tearful abuse and shouted after the &lsquo;Russian
      scoundrels,&rsquo; that he would make a complaint, that he would go to Count Von
      Kizerits himself, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the &lsquo;Russian scoundrels&rsquo; paid no attention to his vociferations, and
      hurried on as fast as they could to the castle. They were all silent, as
      they walked through the garden, though Anna Vassilyevna sighed a little.
      But when they reached the carriages and stood still, they broke into an
      irrepressible, irresistible fit of Homeric laughter. First Shubin
      exploded, shrieking as if he were mad, Bersenyev followed with his
      gurgling guffaw, then Zoya fell into thin tinkling little trills, Anna
      Vassilyevna too suddenly broke down, Elena could not help smiling, and
      even Insarov at last could not resist it. But the loudest, longest, most
      persistent laugh was Uvar Ivanovitch&rsquo;s; he laughed till his sides ached,
      till he choked and panted. He would calm down a little, then would murmur
      through his tears: &lsquo;I&mdash;thought&mdash;what&rsquo;s that splash&mdash;and
      there&mdash;he&mdash;went plop.&rsquo; And with the last word, forced out with
      convulsive effort, his whole frame was shaking with another burst of
      laughter. Zoya made him worse. &lsquo;I saw his legs,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;kicking in the
      air.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; gasped Uvar Ivanovitch, &lsquo;his legs, his legs&mdash;and
      then splash!&mdash;there he plopped in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how did Mr. Insarov manage it? why the German was three times his
      size?&rsquo; said Zoya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; answered Uvar Ivanovitch, rubbing his eyes, &lsquo;I saw; with
      one arm about his waist, he tripped him up, and he went plop! I heard&mdash;a
      splash&mdash;there he went.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after the carriages had started, long after the castle of Tsaritsino
      was out of sight, Uvar Ivanovitch was still unable to regain his
      composure. Shubin, who was again with him in the carriage, began to cry
      shame on him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov felt ashamed. He sat in the coach facing Elena (Bersenyev had
      taken his seat on the box), and he said nothing; she too was silent. He
      thought that she was condemning his action; but she did not condemn him.
      She had been scared at the first minute; then the expression of his face
      had impressed her; afterwards she pondered on it all. It was not quite
      clear to her what the nature of her reflections was. The emotion she had
      felt during the day had passed away; that she realised; but its place had
      been taken by another feeling which she did not yet fully understand. The
      <i>partie de plaisir</i> had been prolonged too late; insensibly evening
      passed into night. The carriage rolled swiftly along, now beside ripening
      cornfields, where the air was heavy and fragrant with the smell of wheat;
      now beside wide meadows, from which a sudden wave of freshness blew
      lightly in the face. The sky seemed to lie like smoke over the horizon. At
      last the moon rose, dark and red. Anna Vassilyevna was dozing; Zoya had
      poked her head out of window and was staring at the road. It occurred to
      Elena at last that she had not spoken to Insarov for more than an hour.
      She turned to him with a trifling question; he at once answered her,
      delighted. Dim sounds began stirring indistinctly in the air, as though
      thousands of voices were talking in the distance; Moscow was coming to
      meet them. Lights twinkled afar off; they grew more and more frequent; at
      last there was the grating of the cobbles under their wheels. Anna
      Vassilyevna awoke, every one in the carriage began talking, though no one
      could hear what was said; everything was drowned in the rattle of the
      cobbles under the two carriages, and the hoofs of the eight horses. Long
      and wearisome seemed the journey from Moscow to Kuntsovo; all the party
      were asleep or silent, leaning with their heads pressed into their
      respective corners; Elena did not close her eyes; she kept them fixed on
      Insarov&rsquo;s dimly-outlined figure. A mood of sadness had come upon Shubin;
      the breeze was blowing into his eyes and irritating him; he retired into
      the collar of his cloak and was on the point of tears. Uvar Ivanovitch was
      snoring blissfully, rocking from side to side. The carriages came to a
      standstill at last. Two men-servants lifted Anna Vassilyevna out of the
      carriage; she was all to pieces, and at parting from her fellow
      travellers, announced that she was &lsquo;nearly dead&rsquo;; they began thanking her,
      but she only repeated, &lsquo;nearly dead.&rsquo; Elena for the first time pressed
      Insarov&rsquo;s hand at parting, and for a long while she sat at her window
      before undressing; Shubin seized an opportunity to whisper to Bersenyev:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, isn&rsquo;t he a hero; he can pitch drunken Germans into the river!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;While you didn&rsquo;t even do that,&rsquo; retorted Bersenyev, and he started
      homewards with Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dawn was already showing in the sky when the two friends reached their
      lodging. The sun had not yet risen, but already the chill of daybreak was
      in the air, a grey dew covered the grass, and the first larks were
      trilling high, high up in the shadowy infinity of air, whence like a
      solitary eye looked out the great, last star.

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after her acquaintance with Insarov, Elena (for the fifth or sixth
      time) began a diary. Here are some extracts from it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>June</i>.... Andrei Petrovitch brings me books, but I can&rsquo;t read them.
      I&rsquo;m ashamed to confess it to him; but I don&rsquo;t like to give back the books,
      tell lies, say I have read them. I feel that would mortify him. He is
      always watching me. He seems devoted to me. A very good man, Andrei
      Petrovitch.... What is it I want? Why is my heart so heavy, so oppressed?
      Why do I watch the birds with envy as they fly past? I feel that I could
      fly with them, fly, where I don&rsquo;t know, but far from here. And isn&rsquo;t that
      desire sinful? I have here mother, father, home. Don&rsquo;t I love them? No, I
      don&rsquo;t love them, as I should like to love. It&rsquo;s dreadful to put that in
      words, but it&rsquo;s the truth. Perhaps I am a great sinner; perhaps that is
      why I am so sad, why I have no peace. Some hand seems laid on me, weighing
      me down, as though I were in prison, and the walls would fall on me
      directly. Why is it others don&rsquo;t feel this? Whom shall I love, if I am
      cold to my own people? It&rsquo;s clear, papa is right; he reproaches me for
      loving nothing but cats and dogs. I must think about that. I pray very
      little; I must pray.... Ah, I think I should know how to love!... I am
      still shy with Mr. Insarov. I don&rsquo;t know why; I believe I&rsquo;m not
      schoolgirlish generally, and he is so simple and kind. Sometimes he has a
      very serious face. He can&rsquo;t give much thought to us. I feel that, and am
      ashamed in a way to take up his time. With Andrei Petrovitch it&rsquo;s quite a
      different thing. I am ready to chat with him the whole day long. But he
      too always talks of Insarov. And such terrible facts he tells me about
      him! I saw him in a dream last night with a dagger in his hand. And he
      seemed to say to me, &ldquo;I will kill you and I will kill myself!&rdquo; What
      silliness!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if some one would say to me: &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s what you must do!&rdquo; Being
      good&mdash;isn&rsquo;t much; doing good... yes, that&rsquo;s the great thing in life.
      But how is one to do good? Oh, if I could learn to control myself! I don&rsquo;t
      know why I am so often thinking of Mr. Insarov. When he comes and sits and
      listens intently, but makes no effort, no exertion himself, I look at him,
      and feel pleased, and that&rsquo;s all, and when he goes, I always go over his
      words, and feel vexed with myself, and upset even. I can&rsquo;t tell why. (He
      speaks French badly and isn&rsquo;t ashamed of it&mdash;I like that.) I always
      think a lot about new people, though. As I talked to him, I suddenly was
      reminded of our butler, Vassily, who rescued an old cripple out of a hut
      that was on fire, and was almost killed himself. Papa called him a brave
      fellow, mamma gave him five roubles, and I felt as though I could fall at
      his feet. And he had a simple face&mdash;stupid-looking even&mdash;and he
      took to drink later on....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I gave a penny to-day to a beggar woman, and she said to me, &ldquo;Why are you
      so sorrowful?&rdquo; I never suspected I looked sorrowful. I think it must come
      from being alone, always alone, for better, for worse! There is no one to
      stretch out a hand to me. Those who come to me, I don&rsquo;t want; and those I
      would choose&mdash;pass me by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with me to-day; my head is confused, I
      want to fall on my knees and beg and pray for mercy. I don&rsquo;t know by whom
      or how, but I feel as if I were being tortured, and inwardly I am
      shrieking in revolt; I weep and can&rsquo;t be quiet.... O my God, subdue these
      outbreaks in me! Thou alone canst aid me, all else is useless; my
      miserable alms-giving, my studies can do nothing, nothing, nothing to help
      me. I should like to go out as a servant somewhere, really; that would do
      me good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is my youth for, what am I living for, why have I a soul, what is it
      all for?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... Insarov, Mr. Insarov&mdash;upon my word I don&rsquo;t know how to write&mdash;still
      interests me, I should like to know what he has within, in his soul? He
      seems so open, so easy to talk to, but I can see nothing. Sometimes he
      looks at me with such searching eyes&mdash;or is that my fancy? Paul keeps
      teasing me. I am angry with Paul. What does he want? He&rsquo;s in love with
      me... but his love&rsquo;s no good to me. He&rsquo;s in love with Zoya too. I&rsquo;m unjust
      to him; he told me yesterday I didn&rsquo;t know how to be unjust by halves...
      that&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s very horrid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I feel one needs unhappiness, or poverty or sickness, or else one
      gets conceited directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... What made Andrei Petrovitch tell me to-day about those two
      Bulgarians! He told me it as it were with some intention. What have I to
      do with Mr. Insarov? I feel cross with Andrei Petrovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... I take my pen and don&rsquo;t know how to begin. How unexpectedly he began
      to talk to me in the garden to-day! How friendly and confiding he was! How
      quickly it happened! As if we were old, old friends and had only just
      recognised each other. How could I have not understood him before? How
      near he is to me now! And&mdash;what&rsquo;s so wonderful&mdash;I feel ever so
      much calmer now. It&rsquo;s ludicrous; yesterday I was angry with Andrei
      Petrovitch, and angry with him, I even called him <i>Mr. Insarov</i>, and
      to-day... Here at last is a true man; some one one may depend upon. He
      won&rsquo;t tell lies; he&rsquo;s the first man I have met who never tells lies; all
      the others tell lies, everything&rsquo;s lying. Andrei Petrovitch, dear good
      friend, why do I wrong you? No! Andrei Petrovitch is more learned than he
      is, even, perhaps more intellectual. But I don&rsquo;t know, he seems so small
      beside him. When he speaks of his country he seems taller, and his face
      grows handsome, and his voice is like steel, and... no... it seems as
      though there were no one in the world before whom he would flinch. And he
      doesn&rsquo;t only talk.... he has acted and he will act I shall ask him.... How
      suddenly he turned to me and smiled!... It&rsquo;s only brothers that smile like
      that! Ah, how glad I am! When he came the first time, I never dreamt that
      we should so soon get to know each other. And now I am even pleased that I
      remained indifferent to him at first. Indifferent? Am I not indifferent
      then now?... It&rsquo;s long since I have felt such inward peace. I feel so
      quiet, so quiet. And there&rsquo;s nothing to write? I see him often and that&rsquo;s
      all. What more is there to write?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... Paul shuts himself up, Andrei Petrovitch has taken to coming less
      often.... poor fellow! I fancy he... But that can never be, though. I like
      talking to Andrei Petrovitch; never a word of self, always of something
      sensible, useful. Very different from Shubin. Shubin&rsquo;s as fine as a
      butterfly, and admires his own finery; which butterflies don&rsquo;t do. But
      both Shubin and Andrei Petrovitch.... I know what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... He enjoys coming to us, I see that. But why? what does he find in me?
      It&rsquo;s true our tastes are alike; he and I, both of us don&rsquo;t care for
      poetry; neither of us knows anything of art. But how much better he is
      than I! He is calm, I am in perpetual excitement; he has chosen his path,
      his aim&mdash;while I&mdash;where am I going? where is my home? He is
      calm, but all his thoughts are far away. The time will come, and he will
      leave us for ever, will go home, there over the sea. Well? God grant he
      may! Any way I shall be glad that I knew him, while he was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he a Russian? No, he could not be Russian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma too likes him; she says: an unassuming young man. Dear mamma! She
      does not understand him. Paul says nothing; he guessed I didn&rsquo;t like his
      hints, but he&rsquo;s jealous of him. Spiteful boy! And what right has he? Did I
      ever... All that&rsquo;s nonsense! What makes all that come into my head?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... Isn&rsquo;t it strange though, that up till now, up to twenty, I have never
      loved any one! I believe that the reason why D.&lsquo;s (I shall call him D.&mdash;I
      like that name Dmitri) soul is so clear, is that he is entirely given up
      to his work, his ideal. What has he to trouble about? When any one has
      utterly... utterly... given himself up, he has little sorrow, he is not
      responsible for anything. It&rsquo;s not <i>I</i> want, but <i>it</i> wants. By
      the way, he and I both love the same flowers. I picked a rose this
      morning, one leaf fell, he picked it up.... I gave him the whole rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... D. often comes to us. Yesterday he spent the whole evening. He wants
      to teach me Bulgarian. I feel happy with him, quite at home, more than at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... The days fly past.... I am happy, and somehow discontent and I am
      thankful to God, and tears are not far off. Oh these hot bright days!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... I am still light-hearted as before, and only at times, and only a
      little, sad. I am happy. Am I happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... It will be long before I forget the expedition yesterday. What
      strange, new, terrible impressions when he suddenly took that great giant
      and flung him like a ball into the water. I was not frightened ... yet he
      frightened me. And afterwards&mdash;what an angry face, almost cruel! How
      he said, &ldquo;He will swim out!&rdquo; It gave me a shock. So I did not understand
      him. And afterwards when they all laughed, when I was laughing, how I felt
      for him! He was ashamed, I felt that he was ashamed before me. He told me
      so afterwards in the carriage in the dark, when I tried to get a good view
      of him and was afraid of him. Yes, he is not to be trifled with, and he is
      a splendid champion. But why that wicked look, those trembling lips, that
      angry fire in his eyes? Or is it, perhaps, inevitable? Isn&rsquo;t it possible
      to be a man, a hero, and to remain soft and gentle? &ldquo;Life is a coarse
      business,&rdquo; he said to me once lately. I repeated that saying to Andrei
      Petrovitch; he did not agree with D. Which of them is right? But the
      beginning of that day! How happy I was, walking beside him, even without
      speaking. ... But I am glad of what happened. I see that it was quite as
      it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... Restlessness again... I am not quite well.... All these days I have
      written nothing in this book, because I have had no wish to write. I felt,
      whatever I write, it won&rsquo;t be what is in my heart. ... And what is in my
      heart? I have had a long talk with him, which revealed a great deal. He
      told me his plan (by the way, I know now how he got the wound in his
      neck.... Good God! when I think he was actually condemned to death, that
      he was only just saved, that he was wounded.... ) He prophesies war and
      will be glad of it. And for all that, I never saw D. so depressed. What
      can he... he!... be depressed by? Papa arrived home from town and came
      upon us two. He looked rather queerly at us. Andrei Petrovitch came; I
      noticed he had grown very thin and pale. He reproved me, saying I behave
      too coldly and inconsiderately to Shubin. I had utterly forgotten Paul&rsquo;s
      existence. I will see him, and try to smooth over my offence. He is
      nothing to me now... nor any one else in the world. Andrei Petrovitch
      talked to me in a sort of commiserating way. What does it all mean? Why is
      everything around me and within me so dark? I feel as if about me and
      within me, something mysterious were happening, for which I want to find
      the right word.... I did not sleep all night; my head aches. What&rsquo;s the
      good of writing? He went away so quickly to-day and I wanted to talk to
      him.... He almost seems to avoid me. Yes, he avoids me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;... The word is found, light has dawned on me! My God, have pity on
      me.... I love him!&rsquo;

      On the very day on which Elena had written this last fatal line in her
      diary, Insarov was sitting in Bersenyev&rsquo;s room, and Bersenyev was standing
      before him with a look of perplexity on his face. Insarov had just
      announced his intention of returning to Moscow the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word!&rsquo; cried Bersenyev. &lsquo;Why, the finest part of the summer is
      just beginning. What will you do in Moscow? What a sudden decision! Or
      have you had news of some sort?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have had no news,&rsquo; replied Insarov; &lsquo;but on thinking things over, I
      find I cannot stop here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can that be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch,&rsquo; said Insarov, &lsquo;be so kind... don&rsquo;t insist, please, I
      am very sorry myself to be leaving you, but it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev looked at him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no persuading you. And so, it&rsquo;s a
      settled matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absolutely settled,&rsquo; replied Insarov, getting up and going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev walked about the room, then took his hat and set off for the
      Stahovs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have something to tell me,&rsquo; Elena said to him, directly they were
      left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, how did you guess?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind; tell me what it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev told her of Insarov&rsquo;s intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena turned white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it mean?&rsquo; she articulated with effort
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know,&rsquo; observed Bersenyev, &lsquo;Dmitri Nikanorovitch does not care to
      give reasons for his actions. But I think... let us sit down, Elena
      Nikolaevna, you don&rsquo;t seem very well.... I fancy I can guess what is the
      real cause of this sudden departure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&mdash;what cause?&rsquo; repeated Elena, and unconsciously she gripped
      tightly Bersenyev&rsquo;s hand in her chill ringers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; began Bersenyev, with a pathetic smile, &lsquo;how can I explain to
      you? I must go back to last spring, to the time when I began to be more
      intimate with Insarov. I used to meet him then at the house of a relative,
      who had a daughter, a very pretty girl I thought that Insarov cared for
      her, and I told him so. He laughed, and answered that I was mistaken, that
      he was quite heart-whole, but if anything of that sort did happen to him,
      he should run away directly, as he did not want, in his own words, for the
      sake of personal feeling, to be false to his cause and his duty. &ldquo;I am a
      Bulgarian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have no need of a Russian love&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well&mdash;so&mdash;now you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; whispered Elena. She
      involuntarily turned away her head, like a man expecting a blow, but she
      still held the hand she had clutched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he said, and his own voice sank, &lsquo;I think that what I fancied
      then has really happened now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is&mdash;you think&mdash;don&rsquo;t torture me!&rsquo; broke suddenly from
      Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; Bersenyev continued hurriedly, &lsquo;that Insarov is in love now
      with a Russian girl, and he is resolved to go, according to his word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena clasped his hand still tighter, and her head drooped still lower, as
      if she would hide from other eyes the flush of shame which suddenly blazed
      over her face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Andrei Petrovitch, you are kind as an angel,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but will he come
      to say goodbye?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I imagine so; he will be sure to come. He wouldn&rsquo;t like to go away&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him, tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But here the poor girl broke down; tears rushed streaming from her eyes,
      and she ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So that&rsquo;s how she loves him,&rsquo; thought Bersenyev, as he walked slowly
      home. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect that; I didn&rsquo;t think she felt so strongly. I am
      kind, she says:&rsquo; he pursued his reflections:... &lsquo;Who can tell what
      feelings, what impulse drove me to tell Elena all that? It was not
      kindness; no, not kindness. It was all the accursed desire to make sure
      whether the dagger is really in the wound. I ought to be content. They
      love each other, and I have been of use to them.... The future go-between
      between science and the Russian public Shubin calls me; it seems as though
      it had been decreed at my birth that I should be a go-between. But if I&rsquo;m
      mistaken? No, I&rsquo;m not mistaken&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bitter for Andrei Petrovitch, and he could not turn his mind to
      Raumer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day at two o&rsquo;clock Insarov arrived at the Stahovs&rsquo;. As though by
      express design, there was a visitor in Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s drawing-room at
      the time, the wife of a neighbouring chief-priest, an excellent and worthy
      woman, though she had had a little unpleasantness with the police, because
      she thought fit, in the hottest part of the day, to bathe in a lake near
      the road, along which a certain dignified general&rsquo;s family used often to
      be passing. The presence of an outside person was at first even a relief
      to Elena, from whose face every trace of colour vanished, directly she
      heard Insarov&rsquo;s step; but her heart sank at the thought that he might go
      without a word with her alone. He, too, seemed confused, and avoided
      meeting her eyes. &lsquo;Surely he will not go directly,&rsquo; thought Elena. Insarov
      was, in fact, turning to take leave of Anna Vassilyevna; Elena hastily
      rose and called him aside to the window. The priest&rsquo;s wife was surprised,
      and tried to turn round; but she was so tightly laced that her stays
      creaked at every movement, and she stayed where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen,&rsquo; said Elena hurriedly; &lsquo;I know what you have come for; Andrei
      Petrovitch told me of your intention, but I beg, I entreat you, do not say
      good-bye to us to-day, but come here to-morrow rather earlier, at eleven.
      I must have a few words with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov bent his head without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not keep you.... You promise me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Insarov bowed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lenotchka, come here,&rsquo; said Anna Vassilyevna, &lsquo;look, what a charming
      reticule.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I worked it myself,&rsquo; observed the priest&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena came away from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov did not stay more than a quarter of an hour at the Stahovs&rsquo;. Elena
      watched him secretly. He was restless and ill at ease. As before, he did
      not know where to look, and he went away strangely and suddenly; he seemed
      to vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly passed that day for Elena; still more slowly dragged on the long,
      long night. Elena sat on her bed, her arms clasping her knees, and her
      head laid on them; then she walked to the window, pressed her burning
      forehead against the cold glass, and thought and thought, going over and
      over the same thoughts till she was exhausted. Her heart seemed turned to
      stone, she did not feel it, but the veins in her head throbbed painfully,
      her hair stifled her, and her lips were dry. &lsquo;He will come... he did not
      say good-bye to mamma... he will not deceive me... Can Andrei Petrovitch
      have been right? It cannot be... He didn&rsquo;t promise to come in words... Can
      I have parted from him for ever&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo; Those were the thoughts
      that never left her, literally never left her; they did not come and come
      again; they were for ever turning like a mist moving about in her brain.
      &lsquo;He loves me!&rsquo; suddenly flashed through her, setting her whole nature on
      fire, and she gazed fixedly into the darkness; a secret smile parted her
      lips, seen by none, but she quickly shook her head, and clasped her hands
      behind her neck, and again her former thought hung like a mist about her.
      Before morning she undressed and went to bed, but she could not sleep. The
      first fiery ray of sunlight fell upon her room... &lsquo;Oh, if he loves me!&rsquo; 
      she cried suddenly, and unabashed by the light shining on her, she opened
      wide her arms... She got up, dressed, and went down. No one in the house
      was awake yet. She went into the garden, but in the garden it was
      peaceful, green, and fresh; the birds chirped so confidingly, and the
      flowers peeped out so gaily that she could not bear it. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she thought,
      &lsquo;if it is true, no blade of grass is happy as I. But is it true?&rsquo; She went
      back to her room and, to kill time, she began changing her dress. But
      everything slipped out of her hands, and she was still sitting
      half-dressed before her looking-glass when she was summoned to morning
      tea. She went down; her mother noticed her pallor, but only said: &lsquo;How
      interesting you are to-day,&rsquo; and taking her in in a glance, she added:
      &lsquo;How well that dress suits you; you should always put it on when you want
      to make an impression on any one.&rsquo; Elena made no reply, and sat down in a
      corner. Meanwhile it struck nine o&rsquo;clock; there were only two haurs now
      till eleven. Elena tried to read, then to sew, then to read again, then
      she vowed to herself to walk a hundred times up and down one alley, and
      paced it a hundred times; then for a long time she watched Anna
      Vassilyevna laying out the cards for patience... and looked at the clock;
      it was not yet ten. Shubin came into the drawing-room. She tried to talk
      to him, and begged his pardon, what for she did not know herself.... Every
      word she uttered did not cost her effort exactly, but roused a kind of
      amazement in herself. Shubin bent over her. She expected ridicule, raised
      her eyes, and saw before her a sorrowful and sympathetic face.... She
      smiled at this face. Shubin, too, smiled at her without speaking, and
      gently left her. She tried to keep him, but could not at once remember
      what to call him. At last it struck eleven. Then she began to wait, to
      wait, and to listen. She could do nothing now; she ceased even to think.
      Her heart was stirred into life again, and began beating louder and
      louder, and strange, to say, the time seemed flying by. A quarter of an
      hour passed, then half an hour; a few minutes more, as Elena thought, had
      passed, when suddenly she started; the clock had struck not twelve, but
      one. &lsquo;He is not coming; he is going away without saying good-bye.&rsquo;... The
      blood rushed to her head with this thought. She felt that she was gasping
      for breath, that she was on the point of sobbing.... She ran to her own
      room, and fell with her face in her clasped hands on to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour she lay motionless; the tears flowed through her fingers
      on to the pillow. Suddenly she raised herself and sat up, something
      strange was passing in her, her face changed, her wet eyes grew dry and
      shining, her brows were bent and her lips compressed. Another half-hour
      passed. Elena, for the last time, strained her ears to listen: was not
      that the familiar voice floating up to her? She got up, put on her hat and
      gloves, threw a cape over her shoulders, and, slipping unnoticed out of
      the house, she went with swift steps along the road leading to Bersenyev&rsquo;s
      lodging.

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elena walked with her head bent and her eyes fixed straight before her.
      She feared nothing, she considered nothing; she wanted to see Insarov once
      more. She went on, not noticing that the sun had long ago disappeared
      behind heavy black clouds, that the wind was roaring by gusts in the trees
      and blowing her dress about her, that the dust had suddenly risen and was
      flying in a cloud along the road.... Large drops of rain were falling, she
      did not even notice it; but it fell faster and heavier, there were flashes
      of lightning and peals of thunder. Elena stood still looking round....
      Fortunately for her, there was a little old broken-down chapel that had
      been built over a disused well not far from the place where she was
      overtaken by the storm. She ran to it and got under the low roof. The rain
      fell in torrents; the sky was completely overcast. In dumb despair Elena
      stared at the thick network of fast-falling drops. Her last hope of
      getting a sight of Insarov was vanishing. A little old beggar-woman came
      into the chapel, shook herself, said with a curtsy: &lsquo;Out of the rain, good
      lady,&rsquo; and with many sighs and groans sat down on a ledge near the well.
      Elena put her hand into her pocket; the old woman noticed this action and
      a light came into her face, yellow and wrinkled now, though once handsome.
      &lsquo;Thank you, dear gracious lady,&rsquo; she was beginning. There happened to be
      no purse in Elena&rsquo;s pocket, but the old woman was still holding out her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no money, grannie,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;but here, take this, it will be
      of use for something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave her her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O-oh, my pretty lady,&rsquo; said the beggar, &lsquo;what do you give your
      handkerchief to me for? For a wedding-present to my grandchild when she&rsquo;s
      married? God reward you for your goodness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A peal of thunder was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord Jesus Christ,&rsquo; muttered the beggar-woman, and she crossed herself
      three times. &lsquo;Why, haven&rsquo;t I seen you before,&rsquo; she added after a brief
      pause. &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you give me alms in Christ&rsquo;s name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked more attentively at the old woman and recognised her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, grannie,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;wasn&rsquo;t it you asked me why I was so
      sorrowful?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, darling, yes. I fancied I knew you. And I think you&rsquo;ve a heart-ache
      still. You seem in trouble now. Here&rsquo;s your handkerchief, too, wet from
      tears to be sure. Oh, you young people, you all have the same sorrow, a
      terrible woe it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sorrow, grannie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my good young lady, you can&rsquo;t deceive an old woman like me. I know
      what your heart is heavy over; your sorrow&rsquo;s not an uncommon one. Sure, I
      have been young too, darling. I have been through that trouble too. Yes.
      And I&rsquo;ll tell you something, for your goodness to me; you&rsquo;ve won a good
      man, not a light of love, you cling to him alone; cling to him stronger
      than death. If it comes off, it comes off,&mdash;if not, it&rsquo;s in God&rsquo;s
      hands. Yes. Why are you wondering at me? I&rsquo;m a fortune-teller. There, I&rsquo;ll
      carry away your sorrow with your handkerchief. I&rsquo;ll carry it away, and
      it&rsquo;s over. See the rain&rsquo;s less; you wait a little longer. It&rsquo;s not the
      first time I&rsquo;ve been wet. Remember, darling; you had a sorrow, the sorrow
      has flown, and there&rsquo;s no memory of it. Good Lord, have mercy on us!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The beggar-woman got up from the edge of the well, went out of the chapel,
      and stole off on her way. Elena stared after her in bewilderment. &lsquo;What
      does this mean?&rsquo; she murmured involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain grew less and less, the sun peeped out for an instant. Elena was
      just preparing to leave her shelter.... Suddenly, ten paces from the
      chapel, she saw Insarov. Wrapt in a cloak he was walking along the very
      road by which Elena had come; he seemed to be hurrying home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She clasped the old rail of the steps for support, and tried to call to
      him, but her voice failed her... Insarov had already passed by without
      raising his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri Nikanorovitch!&rsquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov stopped abruptly, looked round.... For the first minute he did not
      know Elena, but he went up to her at once. &lsquo;You! you here!&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked back in silence into the chapel. Insarov followed Elena. &lsquo;You
      here?&rsquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still silent, and only gazed upon him with a strange, slow, tender
      look. He dropped his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have come from our house?&rsquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No... not from your house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No?&rsquo; repeated Elena, and she tried to smile. &lsquo;Is that how you keep your
      promises? I have been expecting you ever since the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I made no promise yesterday, if you remember, Elena Nikolaevna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Elena faintly smiled, and she passed her hand over her face. Both
      face and hands were very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You meant, then, to go away without saying good-bye to us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Insarov in a surly, thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? After our friendship, after the talks, after everything.... Then if
      I had not met you here by chance.&rsquo; (Elena&rsquo;s voice began to break, and she
      paused an instant)... &lsquo;you would have gone away like that, without even
      shaking hands for the last time, and you would not have cared?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov turned away. &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevnas don&rsquo;t talk like that, please. I&rsquo;m
      not over happy as it is. Believe me, my decision has cost me great effort.
      If you knew&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know,&rsquo; Elena interposed with dismay, &lsquo;why you are
      going.... It seems it&rsquo;s necessary. It seems we must part. You would not
      wound your friends without good reason. But, can friends part like this?
      And we are friends, aren&rsquo;t we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; murmured Elena. Her cheeks were overspread with a faint flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just why I am going away&mdash;because we are not friends. Don&rsquo;t
      force me into saying what I don&rsquo;t want to say, and what I won&rsquo;t say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You used to be so open with me,&rsquo; said Elena rather reproachfully. &lsquo;Do you
      remember?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I used to be able to be open, then I had nothing to conceal; but now&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But now?&rsquo; queried Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But now... now I must go away. Goodbye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If, at that instant, Insarov had lifted his eyes to Elena, he would have
      seen that her face grew brighter and brighter as he frowned and looked
      gloomy; but he kept his eyes obstinately fixed on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, good-bye, Dmitri Nikanorovitch,&rsquo; she began. &lsquo;But at least, since we
      have met, give me your hand now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov was stretching out his hand. &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t even do that,&rsquo; he said,
      and turned away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. Good-bye.&rsquo; And he moved away to the entrance of the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little longer,&rsquo; said Elena. &lsquo;You seem afraid of me. But I am
      braver than you,&rsquo; she added, a faint tremor passing suddenly over her
      whole body. &lsquo;I can tell you... shall I?... how it was you found me here?
      Do you know where I was going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov looked in bewilderment at Elena,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was going to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena hid her face. &lsquo;You mean to force me to say that I love you,&rsquo; she
      whispered. &lsquo;There, I have said it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena!&rsquo; cried Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took his hands, looked at him, and fell on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her close to him, and said nothing. There was no need for him to
      tell her he loved her. From that cry alone, from the instant
      transformation of the whole man, from the heaving of the breast to which
      she clung so confidingly, from the touch of his finger tips in her hair,
      Elena could feel that she was loved. He did not speak, and she needed no
      words. &lsquo;He is here, he loves me... what need of more?&rsquo; The peace of
      perfect bliss, the peace of the harbour reached after storm, of the end
      attained, that heavenly peace which gives significance and beauty even to
      death, filled her with its divine flood. She desired nothing, for she had
      gained all. &lsquo;O my brother, my friend, my dear one!&rsquo; her lips were
      whispering, while she did not know whose was this heart, his or her own,
      which beat so blissfully, and melted against her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless, folding in his strong embrace the young life
      surrendered to him; he felt against his heart this new, infinitely
      precious burden; a passion of tenderness, of gratitude unutterable, was
      crumbling his hard will to dust, and tears unknown till now stood in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not weep; she could only repeat, &lsquo;O my friend, my brother!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you will follow me everywhere?&rsquo; he said to her, a quarter of an hour
      later, still enfolding her and keeping her close to him in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everywhere, to the ends of the earth. Where you are, I will be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you are not deceiving yourself, you know your parents will never
      consent to our marriage?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t deceive myself; I know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know that I&rsquo;m poor&mdash;almost a beggar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I&rsquo;m not a Russian, that it won&rsquo;t be my fate to live in Russia, that
      you will have to break all your ties with your country, with your people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know, too, that I have given myself up to a difficult, thankless
      cause, that I... that we shall have to expose ourselves not to dangers
      only, but to privation, humiliation, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know, I know all&mdash;I love you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you will have to give up all you are accustomed to, that out there
      alone among strangers, you will be forced perhaps to work&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on his lips. &lsquo;I love you, my dear one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He began hotly kissing her slender, rosy hand. Elena did not draw it away
      from his lips, and with a kind of childish delight, with smiling
      curiosity, watched how he covered with kisses, first the palm, then the
      fingers....
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she blushed and hid her face upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her head tenderly and looked steadily into her eyes. &lsquo;Welcome,
      then, my wife, before God and men!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      An hour later, Elena, with her hat in one hand, her cape in the other,
      walked slowly into the drawing-room of the villa. Her hair was in slight
      disorder; on each cheek was to be seen a small bright spot of colour, the
      smile would not leave her lips, her eyes were nearly shutting and half
      hidden under the lids; they, too, were smiling. She could scarcely move
      for weariness, and this weariness was pleasant to her; everything, indeed,
      was pleasant to her. Everything seemed sweet and friendly to her. Uvar
      Ivanovitch was sitting at the window; she went up to him, laid her hand on
      his shoulder, stretched a little, and involuntarily, as it seemed, she
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he inquired, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know what to say. She felt inclined to kiss Uvar Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How he splashed!&rsquo; she explained at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Uvar Ivanovitch did not stir a muscle, and continued to look with
      amazement at Elena. She dropped her hat and cape on to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Uvar Ivanovitch,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am sleepy and tired,&rsquo; and again she
      laughed and sank into a low chair near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;H&rsquo;m,&rsquo; grunted Uvar Ivanovitch, flourishing his fingers, &lsquo;then you ought&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena was looking round her and thinking, &lsquo;From all this I soon must
      part... and strange&mdash;I have no dread, no doubt, no regret.... No, I
      am sorry for mamma.&rsquo; Then the little chapel rose again before her mind,
      again her voice was echoing in it, and she felt his arms about her.
      Joyously, though faintly, her heart fluttered; weighed down by the languor
      of happiness. The old beggar-woman recurred to her mind. &lsquo;She did really
      bear away my sorrow,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;Oh, how happy I am! how undeservedly!
      how soon!&rsquo; If she had let herself go in the least she would have melted
      into sweet, endless tears. She could only restrain them by laughing.
      Whatever attitude she fell into seemed to her the easiest, most
      comfortable possible; she felt as if she were being rocked to sleep. All
      her movements were slow and soft; what had become of her awkwardness, her
      haste? Zoya came in; Elena decided that she had never seen a more charming
      little face; Anna Vassilyevna came in; Elena felt a pang&mdash;but with
      what tenderness she embraced her mother and kissed her on the forehead
      near the hair, already slightly grey! Then she went away to her own room;
      how everything smiled upon her there! With what a sense of shamefaced
      triumph and tranquillity she sat down on her bed&mdash;the very bed on
      which, only three hours ago, she had spent such bitter moments! &lsquo;And yet,
      even then, I knew he loved me,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;even before... Ah, no! it&rsquo;s
      a sin. You are my wife,&rsquo; she whispered, hiding her face in her hands and
      falling on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the evening, she grew more thoughtful. Sadness came upon her at
      the thought that she would not soon see Insarov. He could not without
      awakening suspicion remain at Bersenyev&rsquo;s, and so this was what he and
      Elena had resolved on. Insarov was to return to Moscow and to come over to
      visit them twice before the autumn; on her side she promised to write him
      letters, and, if it were possible, to arrange a meeting with him somewhere
      near Kuntsov. She went down to the drawing-room to tea, and found there
      all the household and Shubin, who looked at her sharply directly she came
      in; she tried to talk to him in a friendly way as of old, but she dreaded
      his penetration, she was afraid of herself. She felt sure that there was
      good reason for his having left her alone for more than a fortnight. Soon
      Bersenyev arrived, and gave Insarov&rsquo;s respects to Anna Vassilyevna with an
      apology for having gone back to Moscow without calling to take leave of
      her. Insarov&rsquo;s name was for the first time during the day pronounced
      before Elena. She felt that she reddened; she realised at the same time
      that she ought to express regret at the sudden departure of such a
      pleasant acquaintance; but she could not force herself to hypocrisy, and
      continued to sit without stirring or speaking, while Anna Vassilyevna
      sighed and lamented. Elena tried to keep near Bersenyev; she was not
      afraid of him, though he even knew part of her secret; she was safe under
      his wing from Shubin, who still persisted in staring at her&mdash;not
      mockingly but attentively. Bersenyev, too, was thrown into perplexity
      during the evening: he had expected to see Elena more gloomy. Happily for
      her, an argument sprang up about art between him and Shubin; she moved
      apart and heard their voices as it were through a dream. By degrees, not
      only they, but the whole room, everything surrounding her, seemed like a
      dream&mdash;everything: the samovar on the table, and Uvar Ivanovitch&rsquo;s
      short waistcoat, and Zoya&rsquo;s polished finger-nails, and the portrait in
      oils of the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovitch on the wall; everything
      retreated, everything was wrapped in mist, everything ceased to exist.
      Only she felt sorry for them all. &lsquo;What are they living for?&rsquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sleepy, Lenotchka?&rsquo; her mother asked her. She did not hear the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A half untrue insinuation, do you say?&rsquo; These words, sharply uttered by
      Shubin, suddenly awakened Elena&rsquo;s attention. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;the
      whole sting lies in that. A true insinuation makes one wretched&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      unchristian&mdash;and to an untrue insinuation a man is indifferent&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      stupid, but at a half true one he feels vexed and impatient. For instance,
      if I say that Elena Nikolaevna is in love with one of us, what sort of
      insinuation would that be, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Monsieur Paul,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;I should like to show myself vexed, but
      really I can&rsquo;t. I am so tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to bed?&rsquo; observed Anna Vassilyevna, who was always
      drowsy in the evening herself, and consequently always eager to send the
      others to bed. &lsquo;Say good-night to me, and go in God&rsquo;s name; Andrei
      Petrovitch will excuse you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena kissed her mother, bowed to all and went away. Shubin accompanied
      her to the door. &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he whispered to her in the doorway,
      &lsquo;you trample on Monsieur Paul, you mercilessly walk over him, but Monsieur
      Paul blesses you and your little feet, and the slippers on your little
      feet, and the soles of your little slippers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena shrugged her shoulders, reluctantly held out her hand to him&mdash;not
      the one Insarov had kissed&mdash;and going up to her room, at once
      undressed, got into bed, and fell asleep. She slept a deep, unstirring
      sleep, as even children rarely sleep&mdash;the sleep of a child
      convalescent after sickness, when its mother sits near its cradle and
      watches it, and listens to its breathing.

    <h2>
      XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come to my room for a minute,&rsquo; Shubin said to Bersenyev, directly the
      latter had taken leave of Anna Vassilyevna: &lsquo;I have something to show
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev followed him to his attic. He was surprised to see a number of
      studies, statuettes, and busts, covered with damp cloths, set about in all
      the corners of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well I see you have been at work in earnest,&rsquo; he observed to Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One must do something,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;If one thing doesn&rsquo;t do, one must
      try another. However, like a true Corsican, I am more concerned with
      revenge than with pure art. <i>Trema, Bisanzia!</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rsquo; said Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, wait a minute. Deign to look this way, gracious friend and
      benefactor, my vengeance number one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin uncovered one figure, and Bersenyev saw a capital bust of Insarov,
      an excellent likeness. The features of the face had been correctly caught
      by Shubin to the minutest detail, and he had given him a fine expression,
      honest, generous, and bold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev went into raptures over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s simply exquisite!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I congratulate you. You must send it
      to the exhibition! Why do you call that magnificent work your vengeance?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, sir, I intended to offer this magnificent work as you call it to
      Elena Nikolaevna on her name day. Do you see the allegory? We are not
      blind, we see what goes on about us, but we are gentlemen, my dear sir,
      and we take our revenge like gentlemen.... But here,&rsquo; added Shubin,
      uncovering another figure, &lsquo;as the artist according to modern aesthetic
      principles enjoys the enviable privilege of embodying in himself every
      sort of baseness which he can turn into a gem of creative art, we in the
      production of this gem, number two, have taken vengeance not as gentlemen,
      but simply en canaille.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He deftly drew off the cloth, and displayed to Bersenyev&rsquo;s eyes a
      statuette in Dantan&rsquo;s style, also of Insarov. Anything cleverer and more
      spiteful could not be imagined. The young Bulgarian was represented as a
      ram standing on his hind-legs, butting forward with his horns. Dull
      solemnity and aggressiveness, obstinacy, clumsiness and narrowness were
      simply printed on the visage of the &lsquo;sire of the woolly flock,&rsquo; and yet
      the likeness to Insarov was so striking that Bersenyev could not help
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? is it amusing?&rsquo; said Shubin. &lsquo;Do you recognise the hero? Do you
      advise me to send it too to the exhibition? That, my dear fellow, I intend
      as a present for myself on my own name day.... Your honour will permit me
      to play the fool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shubin gave three little leaps, kicking himself behind with his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev picked up the cloth off the floor&mdash;and threw it over the
      statuette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you, magnanimous&rsquo;&mdash;began Shubin. &lsquo;Who the devil was it in
      history was so particularly magnanimous? Well, never mind! And now,&rsquo; he
      continued, with melancholy triumph, uncovering a third rather large mass
      of clay, &lsquo;you shall behold something which will show you the humility and
      discernment of your friend. You will realise that he, like a true artist
      again, feels the need and the use of self-castigation. Behold!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth was lifted and Bersenyev saw two heads, modelled side by side
      and close as though growing together.... He did not at once know what was
      the subject, but looking closer, he recognised in one of them Annushka, in
      the other Shubin himself. They were, however, rather caricatures than
      portraits. Annushka was represented as a handsome fat girl with a low
      forehead, eyes lost in layers of fat, and a saucily turned-up nose. Her
      thick lips had an insolent curve; her whole face expressed sensuality,
      carelessness, and boldness, not without goodnature. Himself Shubin had
      modelled as a lean emaciated rake, with sunken cheeks, his thin hair
      hanging in weak wisps about his face, a meaningless expression in his dim
      eyes, and his nose sharp and thin as a dead man&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev turned away with disgust. &lsquo;A nice pair, aren&rsquo;t they, my dear
      fellow?&rsquo; said Shubin; &lsquo;won&rsquo;t you graciously compose a suitable title? For
      the first two I have already thought of titles. On the bust shall be
      inscribed: &ldquo;A hero resolving to liberate his country.&rdquo; On the statuette:
      &ldquo;Look out, sausage-eating Germans!&rdquo; And for this work what do you think of
      &ldquo;The future of the artist Pavel Yakovlitch Shubin?&rdquo; Will that do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave off,&rsquo; replied Bersenyev. &lsquo;Was it worth while to waste your time on
      such a &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; He could not at once fix on a suitable word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disgusting thing, you mean? No, my dear fellow, excuse me, if anything
      ought to go to the exhibition, it&rsquo;s that group.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s simply disgusting,&rsquo; repeated Bersenyev. &lsquo;And besides, it&rsquo;s nonsense.
      You have absolutely no such degrading tendencies to which, unhappily, our
      artists have such a frequent bent. You have simply libelled yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think so?&rsquo; said Shubin gloomily. &lsquo;I have none of them, and if they
      come upon me, the fault is all one person&rsquo;s. Do you know,&rsquo; he added,
      tragically knitting his brows, &lsquo;that I have been trying drinking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I have, by God,&rsquo; rejoined Shubin; and suddenly grinning and
      brightening,&mdash;&lsquo;but I didn&rsquo;t like it, my dear boy, the stuff sticks in
      my throat, and my head afterwards is a perfect drum. The great Lushtchihin
      himself&mdash;Harlampy Lushtchihin&mdash;the greatest drunkard in Moscow,
      and a Great Russian drunkard too, declared there was nothing to be made of
      me. In his words, the bottle does not speak to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev was just going to knock the group over but Shubin stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do, my dear boy, don&rsquo;t smash it; it will serve as a lesson, a
      scare-crow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s what it is, I will spare your scarecrow then,&rsquo; he said. And
      now, &lsquo;Long live eternal true art!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long live true art!&rsquo; put in Shubin. &lsquo;By art the good is better and the
      bad is not all loss!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends shook hands warmly and parted.

    <h2>
      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elena&rsquo;s first sensation on awakening was one of happy consternation. &lsquo;Is
      it possible? Is it possible?&rsquo; she asked herself, and her heart grew faint
      with happiness. Recollections came rushing on her... she was overwhelmed
      by them. Then again she was enfolded by the blissful peace of triumph. But
      in the course of the morning, Elena gradually became possessed by a spirit
      of unrest, and for the remainder of the day she felt listless and weary.
      It was true she knew now what she wanted, but that made it no easier for
      her. That never-to-be forgotten meeting had cast her for ever out of the
      old groove; she was no longer at the same standpoint, she was far away,
      and yet everything went on about her in its accustomed order, everything
      pursued its own course as though nothing were changed; the old life moved
      on its old way, reckoning on Elena&rsquo;s interest and co-operation as of old.
      She tried to begin a letter to Insarov, but that too was a failure; the
      words came on to paper either lifeless or false. Her diary she had put an
      end to by drawing a thick stroke under the last line. That was the past,
      and every thought, all her soul, was turned now to the future. Her heart
      was heavy. To sit with her mother who suspected nothing, to listen to her,
      answer her and talk to her, seemed to Elena something wicked; she felt the
      presence of a kind of falseness in her, she suffered though she had
      nothing to blush for; more than once an almost irresistible desire sprang
      up in her heart to tell everything without reserve, whatever might come of
      it afterwards. &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;did not Dmitri take me away then, from
      that little chapel, wherever he wanted to go? Didn&rsquo;t he tell me I was his
      wife before God? What am I here for?&rsquo; She suddenly began to feel shy of
      every one, even of Uvar Ivanovitch, who was flourishing his fingers in
      more perplexity than ever. Now everything about her seemed neither sweet
      nor friendly, nor even a dream, but, like a nightmare, lay, an immovable
      dead load, on her heart; seeming to reproach her and be indignant with
      her, and not to care to know about her....&lsquo;You are ours in spite of
      everything,&rsquo; she seemed to hear. Even her poor pets, her ill-used birds
      and animals looked at her&mdash;so at least she fancied&mdash;with
      suspicion and hostility. She felt conscience-stricken and ashamed of her
      feelings. &lsquo;This is my home after all,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;my family, my
      country.&rsquo;... &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s no longer your country, nor your family,&rsquo; another
      voice affirmed within her. Terror was overmastering her, and she was vexed
      with her own feebleness. The trial was only beginning and she was losing
      patience already... Was this what she had promised?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not soon gain control of herself. But a week passed and then
      another.... Elena became a little calmer, and grew used to her new
      position. She wrote two little notes to Insarov, and carried them herself
      to the post: she could not for anything&mdash;through shame and through
      pride&mdash;have brought herself to confide in a maid. She was already
      beginning to expect him in person.... But instead of Insarov, one fine
      morning Nikolai Artemyevitch made his appearance.

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one in the house of the retired lieutenant of guards, Stahov, had ever
      seen him so sour, and at the same time so self-confident and important as
      on that day. He walked into the drawing-room in his overcoat and hat, with
      long deliberate stride, stamping with his heels; he approached the
      looking-glass and took a long look at himself, shaking his head and biting
      his lips with imperturbable severity. Anna Vassilyevna met him with
      obvious agitation and secret delight (she never met him otherwise); he did
      not even take off his hat, nor greet her, and in silence gave Elena his
      doe-skin glove to kiss. Anna Vassilyevna began questioning him about the
      progress of his cure; he made her no reply. Uvar Ivanovitch made his
      appearance; he glanced at him and said, &lsquo;bah!&rsquo; He usually behaved coldly
      and haughtily to Uvar Ivanovitch, though he acknowledged in him &lsquo;traces of
      the true Stahov blood.&rsquo; Almost all Russian families of the nobility are
      convinced, as is well known, of the existence of exceptional hereditary
      characteristics, peculiar to them alone; we have more than once heard
      discussions &lsquo;among ourselves&rsquo; of the Podsalaskinsky &lsquo;noses,&rsquo; and the
      &lsquo;Perepreyevsky&rsquo; necks. Zoya came in and sat down facing Nikolai
      Artemyevitch. He grunted, sank into an armchair, asked for coffee, and
      only then took off his hat. Coffee was brought him; he drank a cup, and
      looking at everybody in turn, he growled between his teeth, &lsquo;<i>Sortes,
      s&rsquo;il vous plait</i>,&rsquo; and turning to his wife he added, &lsquo;<i>et vous,
      madame, restez, je vous prie</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They all left the room, except Anna Vassilyevna. Her head was trembling
      with agitation. The solemnity of Nikolai Artemyevitch&rsquo;s preparations
      impressed her. She was expecting something extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she cried, directly the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch flung an indifferent glance at Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing special; what a way you have of assuming the air of a victim at
      once!&rsquo; he began, quite needlessly dropping the corners of his mouth at
      every word. &lsquo;I only want to forewarn you that we shall have a new guest
      dining here to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kurnatovsky, Yegor Andreyevitch. You don&rsquo;t know him. The head secretary
      in the senate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is to dine with us to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was it only to tell me this that you made every one go away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch again flung a glance&mdash;this time one of irony&mdash;at
      Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does that surprise you? Defer your surprise a little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased speaking. Anna Vassilyevna too was silent for a little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have wished&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; she was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you have always looked on me as an &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; man,&rsquo; began Nikolai
      Artemyevitch suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I!&rsquo; muttered Anna Vassilyevna, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And very likely you are right. I don&rsquo;t wish to deny that I have in fact
      sometimes given you just grounds for dissatisfaction&rsquo; (&ldquo;my greys!&rdquo; flashed
      through Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s head), &lsquo;though you must yourself allow, that in
      the condition, as you are aware, of your constitution&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I make no complaint against you, Nikolai Artemyevitch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>C&rsquo;est possible</i>. In any case, I have no intention of justifying
      myself. Time will justify me. But I regard it as my duty to prove to you
      that I understand my duties, and know how to care for&mdash;for the
      welfare of the family entrusted&mdash;entrusted to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of all this?&rsquo; Anna Vassilyevna was thinking. (She
      could not guess that the preceding evening at the English club a
      discussion had arisen in a corner of the smoking-room as to the incapacity
      of Russians to make speeches. &lsquo;Which of us can speak? Mention any one!&rsquo; 
      one of the disputants had exclaimed. &lsquo;Well, Stahov, for instance,&rsquo; had
      answered the other, pointing to Nikolai Artemyevitch, who stood up on the
      spot almost squealing with delight.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For instance,&rsquo; pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, &lsquo;my daughter Elena. Don&rsquo;t
      you consider that the time has come for her to take a decisive step along
      the path&mdash;to be married, I mean to say. All these intellectual and
      philanthropic pursuits are all very well, but only up to a certain point,
      up to a certain age. It&rsquo;s time for her to drop her mistiness, to get out
      of the society of all these artists, scholars, and Montenegrins, and do
      like everybody else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I to understand you?&rsquo; asked Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if you will kindly listen,&rsquo; answered Nikolai Artemyevitch, still
      with the same dropping of the corners of his lips, &lsquo;I will tell you
      plainly, without beating about the bush. I have made acquaintance, I have
      become intimate with this young man, Mr. Kurnatovsky, in the hope of
      having him for a son-in-law. I venture to think that when you see him, you
      will not accuse me of partiality or precipitate judgment.&rsquo; (Nikolai
      Artemyevitch was admiring his own eloquence as he talked.) &lsquo;Of excellent
      education&mdash;educated in the highest legal college&mdash;excellent
      manners, thirty-three years old, and upper-secretary, a councillor, and a
      Stanislas cross on his neck. You, I hope, will do me the justice to allow
      that I do not belong to the number of those <i>peres de famille</i> who
      are mad for position; but you yourself told me that Elena Nikolaevna likes
      practical business men; Yegor Andreyevitch is in the first place a
      business man; now on the other side, my daughter has a weakness for
      generous actions; so let me tell you that Yegor Andreyevitch, directly he
      had attained the possibility&mdash;you understand me&mdash;the possibility
      of living without privation on his salary, at once gave up the yearly
      income assigned him by his father, for the benefit of his brothers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is his father?&rsquo; inquired Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His father? His father is a man well-known in his own line, of the
      highest moral character, <i>un vrai stoicien</i>, a retired major, I
      think, overseer of all the estates of the Count B&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; observed Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! why ah?&rsquo; interposed Nikolai Artemyevitch. &lsquo;Can you be infected with
      prejudice?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I said nothing&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Anna Vassilyevna was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you said, ah!&mdash;However that may be, I have thought it well to
      acquaint you with my way of thinking; and I venture to think&mdash;I
      venture to hope Mr. Kurnatovsky will be received <i>a bras ouverts</i>. He
      is no Montenegrin vagrant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course; I need only call Vanka the cook and order a few extra dishes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are aware that I will not enter into that,&rsquo; said Nikolai
      Artemyevitch; and he got up, put on his hat, and whistling (he had heard
      some one say that whistling was only permissible in a country villa and a
      riding court) went out for a stroll in the garden. Shubin watched him out
      of the little window of his lodge, and in silence put out his tongue at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten minutes to four, a hackney-carriage drove up to the steps of the
      Stahovs&rsquo;s villa, and a man, still young, of prepossessing appearance,
      simply and elegantly dressed, stepped out of it and sent up his name. This
      was Yegor Andreyevitch Kurnatovsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was what, among other things, Elena wrote next day to Insarov:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Congratulate me, dear Dmitri, I have a suitor. He dined with us
      yesterday: papa made his acquaintance at the English club, I fancy, and
      invited him. Of course he did not come yesterday as a suitor. But good
      mamma, to whom papa had made known his hopes, whispered in my ear what
      this guest was. His name is Yegor Andreyevitch Kurnatovsky; he is
      upper-secretary to the Senate. I will first describe to you his
      appearance. He is of medium height, shorter than you, and a good figure;
      his features are regular, he is close-cropped, and wears large whiskers.
      His eyes are rather small (like yours), brown, and quick; he has a flat
      wide mouth; in his eyes and on his lips there is a perpetual sort of
      official smile; it seems to be always on duty there. He behaves very
      simply and speaks precisely, and everything about him is precise; he
      moves, laughs, and eats as though he were doing a duty. &ldquo;How carefully she
      has studied him!&rdquo; you are thinking, perhaps, at this minute. Yes; so as to
      be able to describe him to you. And besides, who wouldn&rsquo;t study her
      suitor! There&rsquo;s something of iron in him&mdash;and dull and empty at the
      same time&mdash;and honest; they say he is really very honest. You, too,
      are made of iron; but not like this man. At dinner he sat next me, and
      facing us sat Shubin. At first the conversation turned on commercial
      undertakings; they say he is very clever in business matters, and was
      almost throwing up his government post to take charge of a large
      manufacturing business. Pity he didn&rsquo;t do it! Then Shubin began to talk
      about the theatre; Mr. Kurnatovsky declared and&mdash;I must confess&mdash;without
      false modesty, that he has no ideas about art. That reminded me of you&mdash;but
      I thought; no, Dmitri and I are ignorant of art in a very different way
      though. This man seemed to mean, &ldquo;I know nothing of it, and it&rsquo;s quite
      superfluous, still it may be admitted in a well-ordered state.&rdquo; He seems,
      however, to think very little about Petersburg and <i>comme il faut</i>:
      he once even called himself one of the proletariat. &lsquo;We are working
      people,&rsquo; he said; I thought if Dmitri had said that, I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      liked it; but he may talk about himself, he may boast if he likes. With me
      he is very attentive; but I kept feeling that a very, very condescending
      superior was talking with me. When he means to praise any one, he says
      So-and-so is a man of principle&mdash;that&rsquo;s his favourite word. He seems
      to be self-confident, hardworking, capable of self-sacrifice (you see, I
      am impartial), that&rsquo;s to say, of sacrificing his own interest; but he is a
      great despot. It would be woeful to fall into his power! At dinner they
      began talking about bribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that in many cases the man who accepts a bribe is not
      to blame; he cannot do otherwise. Still, if he is found out, he must be
      punished without mercy.&rdquo;&rsquo; I cried, &ldquo;Punish an innocent man!&rdquo; &lsquo;&ldquo;Yes; for
      the sake of principle.&rdquo; &lsquo;&ldquo;What principle?&rdquo; asked Shubin. Kurnatovsky
      seemed annoyed or surprised, and said, &ldquo;That needs no explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa, who seems to worship him, put in &ldquo;of course not&rdquo;; and to my
      vexation the conversation stopped there. In the evening Bersenyev came and
      got into a terrific argument with him. I have never seen our good Andrei
      Petrovitch so excited. Mr. Kurnatovsky did not at all deny the utility of
      science, universities, and so on, but still I understood Andrei
      Petrovitch&rsquo;s indignation. The man looks at it all as a sort of gymnastics.
      Shubin came up to me after dinner, and said, &ldquo;This fellow here and some
      one else (he can never bring himself to utter your name) are both
      practical men, but see what a difference; there&rsquo;s the real living ideal
      given to life; and here there&rsquo;s not even a feeling of duty, simply
      official honesty and activity without anything inside it.&rdquo; Shubin is
      clever, and I remembered his words to tell you; but to my mind there is
      nothing in common between you. You have <i>faith</i>, and he has not; for
      a man cannot <i>have faith</i> in himself only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did not go away till late; but mamma had time to inform me that he was
      pleased with me, and papa is in ecstasies. Did he say, I wonder, that I
      was a woman of principle? I was almost telling mamma that I was very
      sorry, but I had a husband already. Why is it papa dislikes you so? Mamma,
      we could soon manage to bring round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my dear one! I have described this gentleman in such detail to deaden
      my heartache. I don&rsquo;t live without you; I am constantly seeing you,
      hearing you. I look forward to seeing you&mdash;only not at our house, as
      you intended&mdash;fancy how wretched and ill at ease we should be!&mdash;but
      you know where I wrote to you&mdash;in that wood. Oh, my dear one! How I
      love you!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks after Kurnatovsky&rsquo;s first visit, Anna Vassilyevna, to Elena&rsquo;s
      great delight, returned to Moscow, to her large wooden house near
      Prechistenka; a house with columns, white lyres and wreaths over every
      window, with an attic, offices, a palisade, a huge green court, a well in
      the court and a dog&rsquo;s kennel near the well. Anna Vassilyevna had never
      left her country villa so early, but this year with the first autumn
      chills her face swelled; Nikolai Artemyevitch for his part, having
      finished his cure, began to want his wife; besides, Augustina
      Christianovna had gone away on a visit to her cousin in Revel; a family of
      foreigners, known as &lsquo;living statues,&rsquo; <i>des poses plastiques</i>, had
      come to Moscow, and the description of them in the <i>Moscow Gazette</i>
      had aroused Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s liveliest curiosity. In short, to stay
      longer at the villa seemed inconvenient, and even, in Nikolai
      Artemyevitch&rsquo;s words, incompatible with the fulfilment of his &lsquo;cherished
      projects.&rsquo; The last fortnight seemed very long to Elena. Kurnatovsky came
      over twice on Sundays; on other days he was busy. He came really to see
      Elena, but talked more to Zoya, who was much pleased with him. &lsquo;<i>Das ist
      ein Mann</i>!&rsquo; she thought to herself, as she looked at his full manly
      face and listened to his self-confident, condescending talk. To her mind,
      no one had such a wonderful voice, no one could pronounce so nicely, &lsquo;I
      had the hon-our,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;I am most de-lighted.&rsquo; Insarov did not come to the
      Stahovs, but Elena saw him once in secret in a little copse by the Moskva
      river, where she arranged to meet him. They hardly had time to say more
      than a few words to each other. Shubin returned to Moscow with Anna
      Vassilyevna; Bersenyev, a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov was sitting in his room, and for the third time looking through
      the letters brought him from Bulgaria by hand; they were afraid to send
      them by post. He was much disturbed by them. Events were developing
      rapidly in the East; the occupation of the Principalities by Russian
      troops had thrown all men&rsquo;s minds into a ferment; the storm was growing&mdash;already
      could be felt the breath of approaching inevitable war. The fire was
      kindling all round, and no one could foresee how far it would go&mdash;where
      it would stop. Old wrongs, long cherished hopes&mdash;all were astir
      again. Insarov&rsquo;s heart throbbed eagerly; his hopes too were being
      realised. &lsquo;But is it not too soon, will it not be in vain?&rsquo; he thought,
      tightly clasping his hands. &lsquo;We are not ready, but so be it! I must go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Something rustled lightly at the door, it flew quickly open, and into the
      room ran Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov, all in a tremor, rushed to her, fell on his knees before her,
      clasped her waist and pressed it close against his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect me?&rsquo; she said, hardly able to draw her breath, she had
      run quickly up the stairs. &lsquo;Dear one! dear one!&mdash;so this is where you
      live? I&rsquo;ve quickly found you. The daughter of your landlord conducted me.
      We arrived the day before yesterday. I meant to write to you, but I
      thought I had better come myself. I have come for a quarter of an hour.
      Get up, shut the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, quickly shut the door, returned to her and took her by the
      hands. He could not speak; he was choking with delight. She looked with a
      smile into his eyes... there was such rapture in them... she felt shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; she said, fondly taking her hand away from him, &lsquo;let me take off
      my hat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She untied the strings of her hat, flung it down, slipped the cape off her
      shoulders, tidied her hair, and sat down on the little old sofa. Insarov
      gazed at her, without stirring, like one enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; she said, not lifting her eyes to him and motioning him to a
      place beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov sat down, not on the sofa, but on the floor at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, take off my gloves,&rsquo; she said in an uncertain voice. She felt
      afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began first to unbutton and then to draw off one glove; he drew it half
      off and greedily pressed his lips to the slender, soft wrist, which was
      white under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena shuddered, and would have pushed him back with the other hand; he
      began kissing the other hand too. Elena drew it away, he threw back his
      head, she looked into his face, bent above him, and their lips touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant passed... she broke away, got up, whispered &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; and went
      quickly up to the writing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am mistress here, you know, so you ought not to have any secrets from
      me,&rsquo; she said, trying to seem at ease, and standing with her back to him.
      &lsquo;What a lot of papers! what are these letters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov knitted his brows. &lsquo;Those letters?&rsquo; he said, getting up, &lsquo;you can
      read them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena turned them over in her hand. &lsquo;There are so many of them, and the
      writing is so fine, and I have to go directly... let them be. They&rsquo;re not
      from a rival, eh?... and they&rsquo;re not in Russian,&rsquo; she added, turning over
      the thin sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov came close to her and fondly touched her waist. She turned
      suddenly to him, smiled brightly at him and leant against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those letters are from Bulgaria, Elena; my friends write to me, they want
      me to come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now? To them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes... now, while there is still time, while it is still possible to
      come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she flung both arms round his neck, &lsquo;You will take me with
      you, yes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her to his heart. &lsquo;O my sweet girl, O my heroine, how you said
      that! But isn&rsquo;t it wicked, isn&rsquo;t it mad for me, a homeless, solitary man,
      to drag you with me... and out there too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut his mouth.... &lsquo;Sh&mdash;or I shall be angry, and never come to
      see you again. Why isn&rsquo;t it all decided, all settled between us? Am I not
      your wife? Can a wife be parted from her husband?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wives don&rsquo;t go into war,&rsquo; he said with a half-mournful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, when they can&rsquo;t stay behind, and I cannot stay here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena, my angel!.. but think, I have, perhaps, to leave Moscow in a
      fortnight. I can&rsquo;t think of university lectures, or finishing my work.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; interrupted Elena, &lsquo;you have to go soon? If you like, I will stop
      at once this minute with you for ever, and not go home, shall I? Shall we
      go at once?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov clasped her in his arms with redoubled warmth. &lsquo;May God so reward
      me then,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;if I am doing wrong! From to-day, we are one for
      ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to stay?&rsquo; asked Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my pure girl; no, my treasure. You shall go back home to-day, only
      keep yourself in readiness. This is a matter we can&rsquo;t manage straight off;
      we must plan it out well. We want money, a passport&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have money,&rsquo; put in Elena. &lsquo;Eighty roubles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not much,&rsquo; observed Insarov; &lsquo;but everything&rsquo;s a help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can get more. I will borrow. I will ask mamma.... No, I won&rsquo;t ask
      mamma for any.... But I can sell my watch.... I have earrings, too, and
      two bracelets... and lace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money&rsquo;s not the chief difficulty, Elena; the passport; your passport, how
      about that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, how about it? Is a passport absolutely necessary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absolutely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena laughed. &lsquo;What a queer idea! I remember when I was little... a maid
      of ours ran away. She was caught, and forgiven, and lived with us a long
      while... but still every one used to call her Tatyana, the runaway. I
      never thought then that I too might perhaps be a runaway like her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? Of course it&rsquo;s better to go with a passport. But if we can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will settle all that later, later, wait a little,&rsquo; said Insarov. &lsquo;Let
      me look about; let me think a little. We will talk over everything
      together thoroughly. I too have money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena pushed back the hair that fell over on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Dmitri! how glorious it will be for us two to set off together!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Insarov, &lsquo;but there, when we get there&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; put in Elena, &lsquo;and won&rsquo;t it be glorious to die together too? but
      no, why should we die? We will live, we are young. How old are you?
      Twenty-six?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, twenty-six.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I am twenty. There is plenty of time before us. Ah, you tried to run
      away from me? You did not want a Russian&rsquo;s love, you Bulgarian! Let me see
      you trying to escape from me now! What would have become of us, if I
      hadn&rsquo;t come to you then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena, you know what forced me to go away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know; you were in love, and you were afraid. But surely you must have
      suspected that you were loved?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I swear on my honour, Elena, I didn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a quick unexpected kiss. &lsquo;There, I love you for that too. And
      goodbye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t stop longer?&rsquo; asked Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, dearest. Do you think it&rsquo;s easy for me to get out alone? The quarter
      of an hour was over long ago.&rsquo; She put on her cape and hat. &lsquo;And you come
      to us to-morrow evening. No, the day after to-morrow. We shall be
      constrained and dreary, but we can&rsquo;t help that; at least we shall see each
      other. Good-bye. Let me go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He embraced her for the last time. &lsquo;Ah, take care, you have broken my
      watch-chain. Oh, what a clumsy boy! There, never mind. It&rsquo;s all the
      better. I will go to Kuznetsky bridge, and leave it to be mended. If I am
      asked, I can say I have been to Kuznetsky bridge.&rsquo; She held the
      door-handle. &lsquo;By-the-way, I forgot to tell you, Monsieur Kurnatovsky will
      certainly make me an offer in a day or two. But the answer I shall make
      him&mdash;will be this&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; She put the thumb of her left hand
      to the tip of her nose and flourished the other fingers in the air.
      &lsquo;Good-bye till we see each other again. Now, I know the way... And don&rsquo;t
      lose any time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena opened the door a little, listened, turned round to Insarov, nodded
      her head, and glided out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute Insarov stood before the closed door, and he too listened.
      The door downstairs into the court slammed. He went up to the sofa, sat
      down, and covered his eyes with his hands. Never before had anything like
      this happened to him. &lsquo;What have I done to deserve such love?&rsquo; he thought.
      &lsquo;Is it a dream?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the delicate scent of mignonette left by Elena in his poor dark little
      room told of her visit. And with it, it seemed that the air was still full
      of the notes of a young voice, and the sound of a light young tread, and
      the warmth and freshness of a young girlish body.

    <h2>
      XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Insarov decided to await more positive news, and began to make
      preparations for departure. The difficulty was a serious one. For him
      personally there were no obstacles. He had only to ask for a passport&mdash;but
      how would it be with Elena? To get her a passport in the legal way was
      impossible. Should he marry her secretly, and should they then go and
      present themselves to the parents?... &lsquo;They would let us go then,&rsquo; he
      thought &lsquo;But if they did not? We would go all the same. But suppose they
      were to make a complaint... if... No, better try to get a passport
      somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to consult (of course mentioning no names) one of his
      acquaintances, an attorney, retired from practice, or perhaps struck off
      the rolls, an old and experienced hand at all sorts of clandestine
      business. This worthy person did not live near; Insarov was a whole hour
      in getting to him in a very sorry droshky, and, to make matters worse, he
      did not find him at home; and on his way back got soaked to the skin by a
      sudden downpour of rain. The next morning, in spite of a rather severe
      headache, Insarov set off a second time to call on the retired attorney.
      The retired attorney listened to him attentively, taking snuff from a
      snuff-box decorated with a picture of a full-bosomed nymph, and glancing
      stealthily at his visitor with his sly, and also snuff-coloured little
      eyes; he heard him to the end, and then demanded &lsquo;greater definiteness in
      the statement of the facts of the case&rsquo;; and observing that Insarov was
      unwilling to launch into particulars (it was against the grain that he had
      come to him at all) he confined himself to the advice to provide himself
      above all things with &lsquo;the needful,&rsquo; and asked him to come to him again,
      &lsquo;when you have,&rsquo; he added, sniffing at the snuff in the open snuff-box,
      &lsquo;augmented your confidence and decreased your diffidence&rsquo; (he talked with
      a broad accent). &lsquo;A passport,&rsquo; he added, as though to himself, &lsquo;is a thing
      that can be arranged; you go a journey, for instance; who&rsquo;s to tell
      whether you&rsquo;re Marya Bredihin or Karolina Vogel-meier?&rsquo; A feeling of
      nausea came over Insarov, but he thanked the attorney, and promised to
      come to him again in a day or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening he went to the Stahovs. Anna Vassilyevna met him
      cordially, reproached him a little for having quite forgotten them, and,
      finding him pale, inquired especially after his health. Nikolai
      Artemyevitch did not say a single word to him; he only stared at him with
      elaborately careless curiosity; Shubin treated him coldly; but Elena
      astounded him. She was expecting him; she had put on for him the very
      dress she wore on the day of their first interview in the chapel; but she
      welcomed him so calmly, and was so polite and carelessly gay, that no one
      looking at her could have believed that this girl&rsquo;s fate was already
      decided, and that it was only the secret consciousness of happy love that
      gave fire to her features, lightness and charm to all her gestures. She
      poured out tea in Zoya&rsquo;s place, jested, chattered; she knew Shubin would
      be watching her, that Insarov was incapable of wearing a mask, and
      incapable of appearing indifferent, and she had prepared herself
      beforehand. She was not mistaken; Shubin never took his eyes off her, and
      Insarov was very silent and gloomy the whole evening. Elena was so happy
      that she even felt an inclination to tease him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, by the way,&rsquo; she said to him suddenly, &lsquo;is your plan getting on at
      all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov was taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What plan?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, have you forgotten?&rsquo; she rejoined, laughing in his face; he alone
      could tell the meaning of that happy laugh: &lsquo;Your Bulgarian selections for
      Russian readers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Quelle bourde</i>!&rsquo; muttered Nikolai Artemyevitch between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zoya sat down to the piano. Elena gave a just perceptible shrug of the
      shoulders, and with her eyes motioned Insarov to the door. Then she twice
      slowly touched the table with her finger, and looked at him. He understood
      that she was promising to see him in two days, and she gave him a quick
      smile when she saw he understood her. Insarov got up and began to take
      leave; he felt unwell. Kurnatovsky arrived. Nikolai Artemyevitch jumped
      up, raised his right hand higher than his head, and softly dropped it into
      the palm of the chief secretary. Insarov would have remained a few minutes
      longer, to have a look at his rival. Elena shook her head unseen; the host
      did not think it necessary to introduce them to one another, and Insarov
      departed, exchanging one last look with Elena. Shubin pondered and
      pondered, and threw himself into a fierce argument with Kurnatovsky on a
      legislative question, about which he had not a single idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov did not sleep all night, and in the morning he felt very ill; he
      set to work, however, putting his papers into order and writing letters,
      but his head was heavy and confused. At dinner time he began to be in a
      fever; he could eat nothing. The fever grew rapidly worse towards evening;
      he had aching pains in all his limbs, and a terrible headache. Insarov lay
      down on the very little sofa on which Elena had lately sat; he thought:
      &lsquo;It serves me right for going to that old rascal,&rsquo; and he tried to
      sleep.... But the illness had by now complete mastery of him. His veins
      were throbbing violently, his blood was on fire, his thoughts were flying
      round like birds. He sank into forgetfulness. He lay like a man felled by
      a blow on his face, and suddenly, it seemed to him, some one was softly
      laughing and whispering over him: he opened his eyes with an effort, the
      light of the flaring candle smote him like a knife.... What was it? the
      old attorney was before him in an Oriental silk gown belted with a silk
      handkerchief, as he had seen him the evening before.... &lsquo;Karolina
      Vogelmeier,&rsquo; muttered his toothless mouth. Insarov stared, and the old man
      grew wide and thick and tall, he was no longer a man, he was a tree....
      Insarov had to climb along its gnarled branches. He clung, and fell with
      his breast on a sharp stone, and Karolina Vogelmeier was sitting on her
      heels, looking like a pedlar-woman, and lisping: &lsquo;Pies, pies, pies for
      sale&rsquo;; and there were streams of blood and swords flashing incessantly....
      Elena! And everything vanished is a crimson chaos.

    <h2>
      XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s some one here looks like a locksmith or something of the sort,&rsquo; 
      Bersenyev was informed the following evening by his servant, who was
      distinguished by a severe deportment and sceptical turn of mind towards
      his master; &lsquo;he wants to see you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask him in,&rsquo; said Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &lsquo;locksmith&rsquo; entered. Bersenyev recognised in him the tailor, the
      landlord of Insarov&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; he asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I came to your honour,&rsquo; began the tailor, shifting from one foot to the
      other, and at times waving his right hand with his cuff clutched in his
      three last fingers. &lsquo;Our lodger, seemingly, is very ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Insarov?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, our lodger, to be sure; yesterday morning he was still on his legs,
      in the evening he asked for nothing but drink; the missis took him some
      water, and at night he began talking away; we could hear him through the
      partition-wall; and this morning he lies without a word like a log, and
      the fever he&rsquo;s in, Lord have mercy on us! I thought, upon my word, he&rsquo;ll
      die for sure; I ought to send word to the police station, I thought. For
      he&rsquo;s so alone; but the missis said: &ldquo;Go to that gentleman,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;at
      whose country place our lodger stayed; maybe he&rsquo;ll tell you what to do, or
      come himself.&rdquo; So I&rsquo;ve come to your honour, for we can&rsquo;t, so to say&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev snatched up his cap, thrust a rouble into the tailor&rsquo;s hand, and
      at once set off with him post haste to Insarov&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found him lying on the sofa, unconscious and not undressed. His face
      was terribly changed. Bersenyev at once ordered the people of the house to
      undress him and put him to bed, while he rushed off himself and returned
      with a doctor. The doctor prescribed leeches, mustard-poultices, and
      calomel, and ordered him to be bled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he dangerously ill?&rsquo; asked Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, very dangerously,&rsquo; answered the doctor. &lsquo;Severe inflammation of the
      lungs; peripneumonia fully developed, and the brain perhaps affected, but
      the patient is young. His very strength is something against him now. I
      was sent for too late; still we will do all that science dictates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was young himself, and still believed in science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev stayed the night. The people of the house seemed kind, and even
      prompt directly there was some one to tell them what was to be done. An
      assistant arrived, and began to carry out the medical measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards morning Insarov revived for a few minutes, recognised Bersenyev,
      asked: &lsquo;Am I ill, then?&rsquo; looked about him with the vague, listless
      bewilderment of a man dangerously ill, and again relapsed into
      unconsciousness. Bersenyev went home, changed his clothes, and, taking a
      few books along with him, he returned to Insarov&rsquo;s lodgings. He made up
      his mind to stay there, at least for a time. He shut in Insarov&rsquo;s bed with
      screens, and arranged a little place for himself by the sofa. The day
      passed slowly and drearily. Bersenyev did not leave the room except to get
      his dinner. The evening came. He lighted a candle with a shade, and
      settled down to a book. Everything was still around. Through the partition
      wall could be heard suppressed whispering in the landlord&rsquo;s room, then a
      yawn, and a sigh. Some one sneezed, and was scolded in a whisper; behind
      the screen was heard the patient&rsquo;s heavy, uneven breathing, sometimes
      broken by a short groan, and the uneasy tossing of his head on the
      pillow.... Strange fancies came over Bersenyev. He found himself in the
      room of a man whose life was hanging on a thread, the man whom, as he
      knew, Elena loved.... He remembered that night when Shubin had overtaken
      him and declared that she loved him, him, Bersenyev! And now.... &lsquo;What am
      I to do now?&rsquo; he asked himself. &lsquo;Let Elena know of his illness? Wait a
      little? This would be worse news for her than what I told her once before;
      strange how fate makes me the go-between between them!&rsquo; He made up his
      mind that it was better to wait a little. His eyes fell on the table
      covered with heaps of papers... &lsquo;Will he carry out his dreams?&rsquo; thought
      Bersenyev. &lsquo;Can it be that all will come to nothing?&rsquo; And he was filled
      with pity for the young life struck down, and he vowed to himself to save
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was an uneasy one. The sick man was very delirious. Several
      times Bersenyev got up from his little sofa, approached the bed on
      tip-toe, and listened with a heavy heart to his disconnected muttering.
      Only once Insarov spoke with sudden distinctness: &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, I won&rsquo;t, she
      mustn&rsquo;t....&rsquo; Bersenyev started and looked at Insarov; his face, suffering
      and death-like at the same time, was immovable, and his hands lay
      powerless. &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; he repeated, scarcely audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor came in the morning, shook his head and wrote fresh
      prescriptions. &lsquo;The crisis is a long way off still,&rsquo; he said, putting on
      his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And after the crisis?&rsquo; asked Bersenyev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The crisis may end in two ways, <i>aut Caesar aut nihil</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went away. Bersenyev walked a few times up and down the street;
      he felt in need of fresh air. He went back and took up a book again.
      Raumer he had finished long ago; he was now making a study of Grote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door softly creaked, and the head of the landlord&rsquo;s daughter,
      covered as usual with a heavy kerchief, was cautiously thrust into the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is the lady,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;who gave me a silver piece.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s head vanished quickly, and in its place appeared Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev jumped up as if he had been stung; but Elena did not stir, nor
      cry out. It seemed as if she understood everything in a single instant. A
      terrible pallor overspread her face, she went up to the screen, looked
      behind it, threw up her arms, and seemed turned to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment more and she would have flung herself on Insarov, but Bersenyev
      stopped her. &lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; he said in a trembling whisper, &lsquo;you
      might be the death of him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was reeling. He led her to the sofa, and made her sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into his face, then her eyes ran over him from head to foot,
      then stared at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will he die?&rsquo; she asked so coldly and quietly that Bersenyev was
      frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;what are you saying? He is
      ill certainly&mdash;and rather seriously&mdash;but we will save him; I
      promise you that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is unconscious?&rsquo; she asked in the same tone of voice as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he is unconscious at present. That&rsquo;s always the case at the early
      stage of these illnesses, but it means nothing, nothing&mdash;I assure
      you. Drink some water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes to his, and he saw she had not heard his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he dies,&rsquo; she said in the same voice,&rsquo; I will die too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Insarov uttered a slight moan; she trembled all over,
      clutched at her head, then began untying the strings of her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing?&rsquo; Bersenyev asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will stay here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will stay&mdash;for long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, perhaps all day, the night, always&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Elena Nikolaevna, control yourself. I could not of course
      have any expectation of seeing you here; but still I&mdash;assume you have
      come for a short time. Remember they may miss you at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will look for you&mdash;find you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna! You see. He cannot now protect you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her head, seemed lost in thought, raised a handkerchief to her
      lips, and convulsive sobs, tearing her by their violence, were suddenly
      wrung from her breast. She threw herself, face downwards, on the sofa,
      trying to stifle them, but still her body heaved and throbbed like a
      captured bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; Bersenyev was repeating over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! What is it?&rsquo; suddenly sounded the voice of Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena started up, and Bersenyev felt rooted to the spot. After waiting a
      little, he went up to the bed. Insarov&rsquo;s head lay on the pillow helpless
      as before; his eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he delirious?&rsquo; whispered Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems so,&rsquo; answered Bersenyev, &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s nothing; it&rsquo;s always so,
      especially if&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When was he taken ill?&rsquo; Elena broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The day before yesterday; I have been here since yesterday. Rely on me,
      Elena Nikolaevna. I will not leave him; everything shall be done. If
      necessary, we will have a consultation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He will die without me,&rsquo; she cried, wringing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my word I will let you hear every day how his illness goes on,
      and if there should be immediate danger&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swear you will send for me at once whenever it may be, day or night,
      write a note straight to me&mdash;I care for nothing now. Do you hear? you
      promise you will do that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise before God&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swear it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I swear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly snatched his hand, and before he had time to pull it away,
      she had bent and pressed her lips to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna, what are you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;I won&rsquo;t have it&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Insarov muttered
      indistinctly, and sighed painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena went up to the screen, her handkerchief pressed between her teeth,
      and bent a long, long look on the sick man. Silent tears rolled down her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; Bersenyev said to her, &lsquo;he might come to himself and
      recognise you; there&rsquo;s no knowing if that wouldn&rsquo;t do harm. Besides, from
      hour to hour I expect the doctor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena took her hat from the sofa, put it on and stood still. Her eyes
      strayed mournfully over the room. She seemed to be remembering....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot go away,&rsquo; she whispered at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev pressed her hand: &lsquo;Try to pull yourself together,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;calm yourself; you are leaving him in my care. I will come to you this
      very evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked at him, said: &lsquo;Oh, my good, kind friend!&rsquo; broke into sobs and
      rushed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev leaned against the door. A feeling of sorrow and bitterness, not
      without a kind of strange consolation, overcame him. &lsquo;My good, kind
      friend!&rsquo; he thought and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is here?&rsquo; he heard Insarov&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev went up to him. &lsquo;I am here, Dmitri Nikanorovitch. How are you?
      How do you feel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you alone?&rsquo; asked the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom do you mean?&rsquo; Bersenyev asked almost in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov was silent. &lsquo;Mignonette,&rsquo; he murmured, and his eyes closed again.

    <h2>
      XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      For eight whole days Insarov lay between life and death. The doctor was
      incessantly visiting him, interested as a young man in a difficult case.
      Shubin heard of Insarov&rsquo;s critical position, and made inquiries after him.
      His compatriots&mdash;Bulgarians&mdash;came; among them Bersenyev
      recognised the two strange figures, who had puzzled him by their
      unexpected visit to the cottage; they all showed genuine sympathy, some
      offered to take Bersenyev&rsquo;s place by the patient&rsquo;s bed-side; but he would
      not consent to that, remembering his promise to Elena. He saw her every
      day and secretly reported to her&mdash;sometimes by word of mouth,
      sometimes in a brief note&mdash;every detail of the illness. With what
      sinkings of the heart she awaited him, how she listened and questioned
      him! She was always on the point of hastening to Insarov herself; but
      Bersenyev begged her not to do this: Insarov was seldom alone. On the
      first day she knew of his illness she herself had almost fallen ill;
      directly she got home, she shut herself up in her room; but she was
      summoned to dinner, and appeared in the dining-room with such a face that
      Anna Vassilyevna was alarmed, and was anxious to put her to bed. Elena
      succeeded, however, in controlling herself. &lsquo;If he dies,&rsquo; she repeated,
      &lsquo;it will be the end of me too.&rsquo; This thought tranquillised her, and
      enabled her to seem indifferent. Besides no one troubled her much; Anna
      Vassilyevna was taken up with her swollen face; Shubin was working
      furiously; Zoya was given up to pensiveness, and disposed to read <i>Werther</i>;
      Nikolai Artemyevitch was much displeased at the frequent visits of &lsquo;the
      scholar,&rsquo; especially as his &lsquo;cherished projects&rsquo; in regard to Kurnatovsky
      were making no way; the practical chief secretary was puzzled and biding
      his time. Elena did not even thank Bersenyev; there are services for which
      thanks are cruel and shameful. Only once at her fourth interview with him&mdash;Insarov
      had passed a very bad night, the doctor had hinted at a consultation&mdash;only
      then she reminded him of his promise. &lsquo;Very well, then let us go,&rsquo; he said
      to her. She got up and was going to get ready. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he decided, &lsquo;let us
      wait till to-morrow.&rsquo; Towards evening Insarov was rather better.
    </p>
    <p>
      For eight days this torture was prolonged. Elena appeared calm; but she
      could eat nothing, and did not sleep at night. There was a dull ache in
      all her limbs; her head seemed full of a sort of dry burning smoke. &lsquo;Our
      young lady&rsquo;s wasting like a candle,&rsquo; her maid said of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last by the ninth day the crisis was passing over. Elena was sitting in
      the drawing-room near Anna Vassilyevna, and, without knowing herself what
      she was doing, was reading her the <i>Moscow Gazette</i>; Bersenyev came
      in. Elena glanced at him&mdash;how rapid, and fearful, and penetrating,
      and tremulous, was the first glance she turned on him every time&mdash;and
      at once she guessed that he brought good news. He was smiling; he nodded
      slightly to her, she got up to go and meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has regained consciousness, he is saved, he will be quite well again
      in a week,&rsquo; he whispered to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena had stretched out her arm as though to ward off a blow, and she said
      nothing, only her lips trembled and a flush of crimson overspread her
      whole face. Bersenyev began to talk to Anna Vassilyevna, and Elena went
      off to her own room, dropped on her knees and fell to praying, to thanking
      God. Light, shining tears trickled down her cheeks. Suddenly she was
      conscious of intense weariness, laid her head down on the pillow,
      whispered &lsquo;poor Andrei Petrovitch!&rsquo; and at once fell asleep with wet
      eheeks and eyelashes. It was long since she had slept or wept.

    <h2>
      XXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bersenyev&rsquo;s words turned out only partly true; the danger was over, but
      Insarov gained strength slowly, and the doctor talked of a complete
      undermining of the whole system. The patient left his bed for all that,
      and began to walk about the room; Bersenyev went home to his own lodging,
      but he came every day to his still feeble friend; and every day as before
      he informed Elena of the state of his health. Insarov did not dare to
      write to her, and only indirectly in his conversations with Bersenyev
      referred to her; but Bersenyev, with assumed carelessness, told him about
      his visits to the Stahovs, trying, however, to give him to understand that
      Elena had been deeply distressed, and that now she was calmer. Elena too
      did not write to Insarov; she had a plan in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Bersenyev had just informed her with a cheerful face that the
      doctor had already allowed Insarov to eat a cutlet, and that he would
      probably soon go out; she seemed absorbed, dropped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Guess, what I want to say to you,&rsquo; she said. Bersenyev was confused. He
      understood her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; he answered, looking away, &lsquo;you want to say that you wish to
      see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena crimsoned, and scarcely audibly, she breathed, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what then? That, I imagine, you can easily do.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; he
      thought, &lsquo;what a loath-some feeling there is in my heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mean that I have already before...&rsquo; said Elena. &lsquo;But I am afraid&mdash;now
      he is, you say, seldom alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not difficult to get over,&rsquo; replied Bersenyev, still not looking
      at her. &lsquo;I, of course, cannot prepare him; but give me a note. Who can
      hinder your writing to him as a good friend, in whom you take an interest?
      There&rsquo;s no harm in that. Appoint&mdash;I mean, write to him when you will
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ashamed,&rsquo; whispered Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the note, I will take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no need of that, but I wanted to ask you&mdash;don&rsquo;t be angry
      with me, Andrei Petrovitch&mdash;don&rsquo;t go to him to-morrow!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bersenyev bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! yes, I understand; very well, very well,&rsquo; and, adding two or three
      words more, he quickly took leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much the better, so much the better,&rsquo; he thought, as he hurried home.
      &lsquo;I have learnt nothing new, but so much the better. What possessed me to
      go hanging on to the edge of another man&rsquo;s happiness? I regret nothing; I
      have done what my conscience told me; but now it is over. Let them be! My
      father was right when he used to say to me: &ldquo;You and I, my dear boy, are
      not Sybarites, we are not aristocrats, we&rsquo;re not the spoilt darlings of
      fortune and nature, we are not even martyrs&mdash;we are workmen and
      nothing more. Put on your leather apron, workman, and take your place at
      your workman&rsquo;s bench, in your dark workshop, and let the sun shine on
      other men! Even our dull life has its own pride, its own happiness!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Insarov got a brief note by the post. &lsquo;Expect me,&rsquo; Elena
      wrote to him, &lsquo;and give orders for no one to see you. A. P. will not
      come.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Insarov read Elena&rsquo;s note, and at once began to set his room to rights;
      asked his landlady to take away the medicine-glasses, took off his
      dressing-gown and put on his coat. His head was swimming and his heart
      throbbing from weakness and delight. His knees were shaking; he dropped on
      to the sofa, and began to look at his watch. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s now a quarter to
      twelve,&rsquo; he said to himself. &lsquo;She can never come before twelve: I will
      think of something else for a quarter of an hour, or I shall break down
      altogether. Before twelve she cannot possibly come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened, and in a light silk gown, all pale, all fresh, young
      and joyful, Elena came in, and with a faint cry of delight she fell on his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are alive, you are mine,&rsquo; she repeated, embracing and stroking his
      head. He was almost swooning, breathless at such closeness, such caresses,
      such bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down near him, holding him fast, and began to gaze at him with
      that smiling, and caressing, and tender look, only to be seen shining in
      the eyes of a loving woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face suddenly clouded over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How thin you have grown, my poor Dmitri,&rsquo; she said, passing her hand over
      his neck; &lsquo;what a beard you have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you have grown thin, my poor Elena,&rsquo; he answered, catching her
      fingers with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her curls gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. You shall see how soon we&rsquo;ll be strong again! The storm
      has blown over, just as it blew over and passed away that day when we met
      in the chapel. Now we are going to live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with a smile only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what a time we have had, Dmitri, what a cruel time! How can people
      outlive those they love? I knew beforehand what Andrei Petrovitch would
      say to me every day, I did really; my life seemed to ebb and flow with
      yours. Welcome back, my Dmitri!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what to say to her. He was longing to throw himself at her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another thing I observed,&rsquo; she went on, pushing back his hair&mdash;&lsquo;I
      made so many observations all this time in my leisure&mdash;when any one
      is very, very miserable, with what stupid attention he follows everything
      that&rsquo;s going on about him! I really sometimes lost myself in gazing at a
      fly, and all the while such chill and terror in my heart! But that&rsquo;s all
      past, all past, isn&rsquo;t it? Everything&rsquo;s bright in the future, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are for me in the future,&rsquo; answered Insarov, &lsquo;so it is bright for
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And for me too! But do you remember, when I was here, not the last time&mdash;no,
      not the last time,&rsquo; she repeated with an involuntary shudder, &lsquo;when we
      were talking, I spoke of death, I don&rsquo;t know why; I never suspected then
      that it was keeping watch on us. But you are well now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m much better, I&rsquo;m nearly well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are well, you are not dead. Oh, how happy I am!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A short silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena?&rsquo; said Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dearest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me, did it never occur to you that this illness was sent us as a
      punishment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked seriously at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That idea did come into my head, Dmitri. But I thought: what am I to be
      punished for? What duty have I transgressed, against whom have I sinned?
      Perhaps my conscience is not like other people&rsquo;s, but it was silent; or
      perhaps I am guilty towards you? I hinder you, I stop you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t stop me, Elena; we will go together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Dmitri, let us go together; I will follow you.... That is my duty. I
      love you.... I know no other duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Elena!&rsquo; said Insarov, &lsquo;what chains every word of yours fastens on me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why talk of chains?&rsquo; she interposed. &lsquo;We are free people, you and I.
      Yes,&rsquo; she went on, looking musingly on the floor, while with one hand she
      still stroked his hair, &lsquo;I experienced much lately of which I had never
      had any idea! If any one had told me beforehand that I, a young lady, well
      brought up, should go out from home alone on all sorts of made-up excuses,
      and to go where? to a young man&rsquo;s lodgings&mdash;how indignant I should
      have been! And that has all come about, and I feel no indignation
      whatever. Really!&rsquo; she added, and turned to Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with such an expression of adoration, that she softly
      dropped her hand from his hair over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri!&rsquo; she began again, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know of course, I saw you there in
      that dreadful bed, I saw you in the clutches of death, unconscious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You saw me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a little. &lsquo;And Bersenyev was here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov bowed down before her. &lsquo;O Elena!&rsquo; he whispered, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t dare to
      look at you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why? Andrei Petrovitch is so good. I was not ashamed before him. And what
      have I to be ashamed of? I am ready to tell all the world that I am
      yours.... And Andrei Petrovitch I trust like a brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He saved me!&rsquo; cried Insarov. &lsquo;He is the noblest, kindest of men!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes... And do you know I owe everything to him? Do you know that it was
      he who first told me that you loved me? And if I could tell you
      everything.... Yes, he is a noble man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov looked steadily at Elena. &lsquo;He is in love with you, isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena dropped her eyes. &lsquo;He did love me,&rsquo; she said in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov pressed her hand warmly. &lsquo;Oh you Russians,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you have
      hearts of pure gold! And he, he has been waiting on me, he has not slept
      at night. And you, you, my angel.... No reproaches, no hesitations... and
      all this for me, for me&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, all for you, because they love you, Ah, Dmitri! How strange it
      is! I think I have talked to you of it before, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I
      like to repeat it, and you will like to hear it. When I saw you the first
      time&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are there tears in your eyes?&rsquo; Insarov interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tears? Are there?&rsquo; She wiped her eyes with her handkerchief. &lsquo;Oh, what a
      silly boy! He doesn&rsquo;t know yet that people weep from happiness. I wanted
      to tell you: when I saw you the first time, I saw nothing special in you,
      really. I remember, Shubin struck me much more at first, though I never
      loved him, and as for Andrei Petrovitch&mdash;oh, there was a moment when
      I thought: isn&rsquo;t this he? And with you there was nothing of that sort; but
      afterwards&mdash;afterwards&mdash;you took my heart by storm!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have pity on me,&rsquo; began Insarov. He tried to get up, but dropped down on
      to the sofa again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rsquo; inquired Elena anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing.... I am still rather weak. I am not strong enough yet for such
      happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then sit quietly. Don&rsquo;t dare to move, don&rsquo;t get excited,&rsquo; she added,
      threatening him with her finger. &lsquo;And why have you left off your
      dressing-gown? It&rsquo;s too soon to begin to be a dandy! Sit down and I will
      tell you stories. Listen and be quiet. To talk much is bad for you after
      your illness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to talk to him about Shubin, about Kurnatovsky, and what she had
      been doing for the last fortnight, of how war seemed, judging from the
      newspapers, inevitable, and so directly he was perfectly well again, he
      must, without losing a minute, make arrangements for them to start. All
      this she told him sitting beside him, leaning on his shoulder....
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to her, listened, turning pale and red. Sometimes he tried to
      stop her; suddenly he drew himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena,&rsquo; he said to her in a strange, hard voice &lsquo;leave me, go away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; she replied in bewilderment &lsquo;You feel ill?&rsquo; she added quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No... I&rsquo;m all right... but, please, leave me now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. You drive me away?.. What are you doing?&rsquo; she
      said suddenly; he had bent over from the sofa almost to the ground, and
      was pressing her feet to his lips. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Dmitri.... Dmitri&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then leave me! You see, Elena, when I was taken ill, I did not lose
      consciousness at first; I knew I was on the edge of the abyss; even in the
      fever, in delirium I knew, I felt vaguely that it was death coming to me,
      I took leave of life, of you, of everything; I gave up hope.... And this
      return to life so suddenly; this light after the darkness, you&mdash;you&mdash;near
      me, with me&mdash;your voice, your breath.... It&rsquo;s more than I can stand!
      I feel I love you passionately, I hear you call yourself mine, I cannot
      answer for myself... You must go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri,&rsquo; whispered Elena, and she nestled her head on his shoulder. Only
      now she understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;I love you, you know that; I am ready to give my
      life for you.... Why have you come to me now, when I am weak, when I can&rsquo;t
      control myself, when all my blood&rsquo;s on fire... you are mine, you say...
      you love me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri,&rsquo; she repeated; she flushed all over, and pressed still closer to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena, have pity on me; go away, I feel as if I should die.... I can&rsquo;t
      stand these violent emotions... my whole soul yearns for you ... think,
      death was almost parting us.. and now you are here, you are in my arms...
      Elena&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling all over. &lsquo;Take me, then,&rsquo; she whispered scarcely above
      her breath.

      XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch was walking up and down in his study with a scowl on
      his face. Shubin was sitting at the window with his legs crossed,
      tranquilly smoking a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave off tramping from corner to corner, please,&rsquo; he observed, knocking
      the ash off his cigar. &lsquo;I keep expecting you to speak; there&rsquo;s a rick in
      my neck from watching you. Besides, there&rsquo;s something artificial,
      melodramatic in your striding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can never do anything but joke,&rsquo; responded Nikolai Artemyevitch. &lsquo;You
      won&rsquo;t enter into my position, you refuse to realise that I am used to that
      woman, that I am attached to her in fact, that her absence is bound to
      distress me. Here it&rsquo;s October, winter is upon us. ... What can she be
      doing in Revel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must be knitting stockings&mdash;for herself; for herself&mdash;not
      for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may laugh, you may laugh; but I tell you I know no woman like her.
      Such honesty; such disinterestedness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has she cashed that bill yet?&rsquo; inquired Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such disinterestedness,&rsquo; repeated Nikolai Artemyevitch; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      astonishing. They tell me there are a million other women in the world,
      but I say, show me the million; show me the million, I say; <i>ces femmes,
      qu&rsquo;on me les montre</i>! And she doesn&rsquo;t write&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s killing
      me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re eloquent as Pythagoras,&rsquo; remarked Shubin; &lsquo;but do you know what I
      would advise you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When Augustina Christianovna comes back&mdash;you take my meaning?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes; well, what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When you see her again&mdash;you follow the line of my thought?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try beating her; see what that would do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch turned away exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought he was really going to give me some practical advice. But what
      can one expect from him! An artist, a man of no principles&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No principles! By the way, I&rsquo;m told your favourite Mr. Kurnatovsky, the
      man of principle, cleaned you out of a hundred roubles last night. That
      was hardly delicate, you must own now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of it? We were playing high. Of course, I might expect&mdash;but
      they understand so little how to appreciate him in this house&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That he thought: get what I can!&rsquo; put in Shubin: &lsquo;whether he&rsquo;s to be my
      father-in-law or not, is still on the knees of the gods, but a hundred
      roubles is worth something to a man who doesn&rsquo;t take bribes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father-in-law! How the devil am I his father-in-law? <i>Vous revez, mon
      cher</i>. Of course, any other girl would be delighted with such a suitor.
      Only consider: a man of spirit and intellect, who has gained a position in
      the world, served in two provinces&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Led the governor in one of them by the nose,&rsquo; remarked Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very likely. To be sure, that&rsquo;s how it should be. Practical, a business
      man&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And a capital hand at cards,&rsquo; Shubin remarked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, and a capital hand at cards. But Elena Nikolaevna.... Is
      there any understanding her? I should be glad to know if there is any one
      who would undertake to make out what it is she wants. One day she&rsquo;s
      cheerful, another she&rsquo;s dull; all of a sudden she&rsquo;s so thin there&rsquo;s no
      looking at her, and then suddenly she&rsquo;s well again, and all without any
      apparent reason&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A disagreeable-looking man-servant came in with a cup of coffee, cream and
      sugar on a tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The father is pleased with a suitor,&rsquo; pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch,
      breaking off a lump of sugar; &lsquo;but what is that to the daughter! That was
      all very well in the old patriarchal days, but now we have changed all
      that. <i>Nous avons change tout ca</i>. Nowadays a young girl talks to any
      one she thinks fit, reads what she thinks fit; she goes about Moscow alone
      without a groom or a maid, just as in Paris; and all that is permitted.
      The other day I asked, &ldquo;Where is Elena Nikolaevna?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m told she has gone
      out. Where? No one knows. Is that&mdash;the proper thing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take your coffee, and let the man go,&rsquo; said Shubin. &lsquo;You say yourself
      that one ought not <i>devant les domestiques</i>&rsquo; he added in an
      undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant gave Shubin a dubious look, while Nikolai Artemyevitch took
      the cup of coffee, added some cream, and seized some ten lumps of sugar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was just going to say when the servant came in,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;that I
      count for nothing in this house. That&rsquo;s the long and short of the matter.
      For nowadays every one judges from appearances; one man&rsquo;s an empty-headed
      fool, but gives himself airs of importance, and he&rsquo;s respected; while
      another, very likely, has talents which might&mdash;which might gain him
      great distinction, but through modesty&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a born statesman?&rsquo; asked Shubin in a jeering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give over playing the fool!&rsquo; Nikolai Artemyevitch cried with heat. &lsquo;You
      forget yourself! Here you have another proof that I count for nothing in
      this house, nothing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anna Vassilyevna ill-uses you... poor fellow!&rsquo; said Shubin, stretching.
      &lsquo;Ah, Nikolai Artemyevitch, we&rsquo;re a pair of sinners! You had much better be
      getting a little present ready for Anna Vassilyevna, It&rsquo;s her birthday in
      a day or two, and you know how she appreciates the least attention on your
      part.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; answered Nikolai Artemyevitch hastily. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to
      you for reminding me. Of course, of course; to be sure. I have a little
      thing, a dressing-case, I bought it the other day at Rosenstrauch&rsquo;s; but I
      don&rsquo;t know really if it will do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you bought it for her, the lady at Revel?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, certainly.&mdash;I had some idea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, in that case, it will be sure to do.&rsquo; Shubin got up from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we going out this evening, Pavel Yakovlitch, eh?&rsquo; Nikolai
      Artemyevitch asked with an amicable leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why yes, you are going to your club.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After the club... after the club.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin stretched himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Nikolai Artemyevitch, I want to work to-morrow. Another time.&rsquo; And he
      walked off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch scowled, walked twice up and down the room, took a
      velvet box with the dressing-case out of the bureau and looked at it a
      long while, rubbing it with a silk handkerchief. Then he sat down before a
      looking-glass and began carefully arranging his thick black hair, turning
      his head to right and to left with a dignified countenance, his tongue
      pressed into his cheek, never taking his eyes off his parting. Some one
      coughed behind his back; he looked round and saw the manservant who had
      brought him in his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; he asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikolai Artemyevitch,&rsquo; said the man with a certain solemnity, &lsquo;you are
      our master?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that; what next!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikolai Artemyevitch, graciously do not be angry with me; but I, having
      been in your honour&rsquo;s service from a boy, am bound in dutiful devotion to
      bring you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well what is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shifted uneasily as he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You condescended to say, your honour,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;that your honour did
      not know where Elena Nikolaevna was pleased to go. I have information
      about that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What lies are you telling, idiot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s as your honour likes, but T saw our young lady three days ago, as
      she was pleased to go into a house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where? what? what house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a house, near Povarsky. Not far from here. I even asked the doorkeeper
      who were the people living there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch stamped with his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence, scoundrel! How dare you?... Elena Nikolaevna, in the goodness of
      her heart, goes to visit the poor and you... Be off, fool!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified servant was rushing to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; cried Nikolai Artemyevitch. &lsquo;What did the doorkeeper say to you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no&mdash;nothing&mdash;he said nothing&mdash;He told me&mdash;a stu&mdash;student&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence, scoundrel! Listen, you dirty beast; if you ever breathe a word
      in your dreams even&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy on us&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence! if you blab&mdash;if any one&mdash;if I find out&mdash;you shall
      find no hiding-place even underground! Do you hear? You can go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Heavens, merciful powers! what does it mean?&rsquo; thought Nikolai
      Artemyevitch when he was left alone. &lsquo;What did that idiot tell me? Eh? I
      shall have to find out, though, what house it is, and who lives there. I
      must go myself. Has it come to this!... <i>Un laquais! Quelle humiliation!</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And repeating aloud: &lsquo;<i>Un laquais!</i>&rsquo; Nikolai Artemyevitch shut the
      dressing-case up in the bureau, and went up to Anna Vassilyevna. He found
      her in bed with her face tied up. But the sight of her sufferings only
      irritated him, and he very soon reduced her to tears.

    <h2>
      XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the storm gathering in the East was breaking. Turkey had
      declared war on Russia; the time fixed for the evacuation of the
      Principalities had already expired, the day of the disaster of Sinope was
      not far off. The last letters received by Insarov summoned him urgently to
      his country. His health was not yet restored; he coughed, suffered from
      weakness and slight attacks of fever, but he was scarcely ever at home.
      His heart was fired, he no longer thought of his illness. He was for ever
      rushing about Moscow, having secret interviews with various persons,
      writing for whole nights, disappearing for whole days; he had informed his
      landlord that he was going away shortly, and had presented him already
      with his scanty furniture. Elena too on her side was getting ready for
      departure. One wet evening she was sitting in her room, and listening with
      involuntary depression to the sighing of the wind, while she hemmed
      handkerchiefs. Her maid came in and told her that her father was in her
      mother&rsquo;s room and sent for her there. &lsquo;Your mamma is crying,&rsquo; she
      whispered after the retreating Elena, &lsquo;and your papa is angry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena gave a slight shrug and went into Anna Vassflyevna&rsquo;s room. Nikolai
      Artemyevitch&rsquo;s kind-hearted spouse was half lying on a reclining chair,
      sniffing a handkerchief steeped in <i>eau de Cologne</i>; he himself was
      standing at the hearth, every button buttoned up, in a high, hard cravat,
      with a stiffly starched collar; his deportment had a vague suggestion of
      some parliamentary orator. With an orator&rsquo;s wave of the arm he motioned
      his daughter to a chair, and when she, not understanding his gesture,
      looked inquiringly at him, he brought out with dignity, without turning
      his head: &lsquo;I beg you to be seated.&rsquo; Nikolai Artemyevitch always used the
      formal plural in addressing his wife, but only on extraordinary occasions
      in addressing his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna blew her nose tearfully. Nikolai Artemyevitch thrust his
      fingers between his coat-buttons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sent for you, Elena Nikolaevna,&rsquo; he began after a protracted silence,
      &lsquo;in order to have an explanation with you, or rather in order to ask you
      for an explanation. I am displeased with you&mdash;or no&mdash;that is too
      little to say: your behaviour is a pain and an outrage to me&mdash;to me
      and to your mother&mdash;your mother whom you see here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch was giving vent only to the few bass notes in his
      voice. Elena gazed in silence at him, then at Anna Vassilyevna and turned
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was a time,&rsquo; Nikolai Artemyevitch resumed, &lsquo;when daughters did not
      allow themselves to look down on their parents&mdash;when the parental
      authority forced the disobedient to tremble. That time has passed,
      unhappily: so at least many persons imagine; but let me tell you, there
      are still laws which do not permit&mdash;do not permit&mdash;in fact there
      are still laws. I beg you to mark that: there are still laws&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, papa,&rsquo; Elena was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg you not to interrupt me. Let us turn in thought to the past. I and
      Anna Vassilyevna have performed our duty. I and Anna Vassilyevna have
      spared nothing in your education: neither care nor expense. What you have
      gained from our care&mdash;is a different question; but I had the right to
      expect&mdash;I and Anna Vassilyevna had the right to expect that you would
      at least hold sacred the principles of morality which we have&mdash;<i>que
      nous avons inculques</i>, which we have instilled into you, our only
      daughter. We had the right to expect that no new &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; could touch that,
      so to speak, holy shrine. And what do we find? I am not now speaking of
      frivolities characteristic of your sex, and age, but who could have
      anticipated that you could so far forget yourself&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;I know what you are going to say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t know what I am going to say!&rsquo; cried Nikolai Artemyevitch in
      a falsetto shriek, suddenly losing the majesty of his oratorical pose, the
      smooth dignity of his speech, and his bass notes. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know, vile
      hussy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, <i>Nicolas</i>,&rsquo; murmured Anna Vassilyevna, &lsquo;<i>vous me
      faites mourir</i>?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me <i>que je vous fais mourir</i>, Anna Vassilyevna! You can&rsquo;t
      conceive what you will hear directly! Prepare yourself for the worst, I
      warn you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna seemed stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; resumed Nikolai Artemyevitch, turning to Elena, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know what
      I am going to say!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to blame towards you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, at last!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to blame towards you,&rsquo; pursued Elena, &lsquo;for not having long ago
      confessed&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you know,&rsquo; Nikolai Artemyevitch interrupted, &lsquo;that I can crush you
      with one word?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena raised her eyes to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, madam, with one word! It&rsquo;s useless to look at me!&rsquo; (He crossed his
      arms on his breast.) &lsquo;Allow me to ask you, do you know a certain house
      near Povarsky? Have you visited that house?&rsquo; (He stamped.) &lsquo;Answer me,
      worthless girl, and don&rsquo;t try to hide the truth. People, people, servants,
      <i>madam, de vils laquais</i> have seen you, as you went in there, to your&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena was crimson, her eyes were blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no need to hide anything,&rsquo; she declared. &lsquo;Yes, I have visited that
      house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exactly! Do you hear, do you hear, Anna Vassilyevna? And you know, I
      presume, who lives there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know; my husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch&rsquo;s eyes were starting out of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My husband,&rsquo; repeated Elena; &lsquo;I am married to Dmitri Nikanorovitch
      Insarov.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You?&mdash;married?&rsquo;&mdash;was all Anna Vassilyevna could articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, mamma.... Forgive me. A fortnight ago, we were secretly married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna fell back in her chair; Nikolai Artemyevitch stepped two
      paces back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Married! To that vagrant, that Montenegrin! the daughter of Nikolai
      Stahov of the higher nobility married to a vagrant, a nobody, without her
      parents&rsquo; sanction! And you imagine I shall let the matter rest, that I
      shall not make a complaint, that I will allow you&mdash;that you&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;To
      the nunnery with you, and he shall go to prison, to hard labour! Anna
      Vassilyevna, inform her at once that you will cut off her inheritance!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikolai Artemyevitch, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; moaned Anna Vassilyevna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when and how was this done? Who married you? where? how? Good God!
      what will all our friends think, what will the world say! And you,
      shameless hypocrite, could go on living under your parents&rsquo; roof after
      such an act! Had you no fear of&mdash;the wrath of heaven?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa&rsquo; said Elena (she was trembling from head to foot but her voice was
      steady), &lsquo;you are at liberty to do with me as you please, but you need not
      accuse me of shamelessness, and hypocrisy. I did not want&mdash;to give
      you pain before, but I should have had to tell you all myself in a few
      days, because we are going away&mdash;my husband and I&mdash;from here
      next week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going away? Where to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To his own country, to Bulgaria.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the Turks!&rsquo; cried Anna Vassilyevna and fell into a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena ran to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Away!&rsquo; clamoured Nikolai Artemyevitch, seizing his daughter by the arm,
      &lsquo;away, unworthy girl!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that instant the door of the room opened, and a pale face with
      glittering eyes appeared: it was the face of Shubin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nikolai Artemyevitch!&rsquo; he shouted at the top of his voice, &lsquo;Augustina
      Christianovna is here and is asking for you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch turned round infuriated, threatening Shubin with his
      fist; he stood still a minute and rapidly went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena fell at her mother&rsquo;s feet and embraced her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch was lying on his bed. A shirt without a collar, fastened
      with a heavy stud enfolded his thick neck and fell in full flowing folds
      over the almost feminine contours of his chest, leaving visible a large
      cypress-wood cross and an amulet. His ample limbs were covered with the
      lightest bedclothes. On the little table by the bedside a candle was
      burning dimly beside a jug of kvas, and on the bed at Uvar ivanovitch&rsquo;s
      feet was sitting Shubin in a dejected pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he was saying meditatively, &lsquo;she is married and getting ready to go
      away. Your nephew was bawling and shouting for the benefit of the whole
      house; he had shut himself up for greater privacy in his wife&rsquo;s bedroom,
      but not merely the maids and the footmen, the coachman even could hear it
      all! Now he&rsquo;s just tearing and raving round; he all but gave me a
      thrashing, he&rsquo;s bringing a father&rsquo;s curse on the scene now, as cross as a
      bear with a sore head; but that&rsquo;s of no importance. Anna Vassilyevna&rsquo;s
      crushed, but she&rsquo;s much more brokenhearted at her daughter leaving her
      than at her marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A mother,&rsquo; he commented, &lsquo;to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your nephew,&rsquo; resumed Shubin, &lsquo;threatens to lodge a complaint with the
      Metropolitan and the General-Governor and the Minister, but it will end by
      her going. A happy thought to ruin his own daughter! He&rsquo;ll crow a little
      and then lower his colours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;d no right,&rsquo; observed Uvar Ivanovitch, and he drank out of the jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure. But what a storm of criticism, gossip, and comments will be
      raised in Moscow! She&rsquo;s not afraid of them.... Besides she&rsquo;s above them.
      She&rsquo;s going away... and it&rsquo;s awful to think where she&rsquo;s going&mdash;to
      such a distance, such a wilderness! What future awaits her there? I seem
      to see her setting off from a posting station in a snow-storm with thirty
      degrees of frost. She&rsquo;s leaving her country, and her people; but I
      understand her doing it. Whom is she leaving here behind her? What people
      has she seen? Kurnatovsky and Bersenyev and our humble selves; and these
      are the best she&rsquo;s seen. What is there to regret about it? One thing&rsquo;s
      bad; I&rsquo;m told her husband&mdash;the devil, how that word sticks in my
      throat!&mdash;Insarov, I&rsquo;m told, is spitting blood; that&rsquo;s a bad lookout.
      I saw him the other day: his face&mdash;you could model Brutus from it
      straight off. Do you know who Brutus was, Uvar Ivanovitch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is there to know? a man to be sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely so: he was a &ldquo;man.&rdquo; Yes he&rsquo;s a wonderful face, but unhealthy,
      very unhealthy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For fighting... it makes no difference,&rsquo; observed Uvar Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For fighting it makes no difference, certainly; you are pleased to
      express yourself with great justice to-day; but for living it makes all
      the difference. And you see she wants to live with him a little while.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A youthful affair,&rsquo; responded Uvar Ivanovitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, a youthful, glorious, bold affair. Death, life, conflict, defeat,
      triumph, love, freedom, country.... Good God, grant as much to all of us!
      That&rsquo;s a very different thing from sitting up to one&rsquo;s neck in a bog, and
      pretending it&rsquo;s all the same to you, when in fact it really is all the
      same. While there&mdash;the strings are tuned to the highest pitch, to
      play to all the world or to break!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shubin&rsquo;s head sank on to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he resumed, after a prolonged silence, &lsquo;Insarov deserves her. What
      nonsense, though! No one deserves her... Insarov... Insarov ... What&rsquo;s the
      use of pretended modesty? We&rsquo;ll own he&rsquo;s a fine fellow, he stands on his
      own feet, though up to the present he has done no more than we poor
      sinners; and are we such absolutely worthless dirt? Am I such dirt, Uvar
      Ivanovitch? Has God been hard on me in every way? Has He given me no
      talents, no abilities? Who knows, perhaps, the name of Pavel Shubin will
      in time be a great name? You see that bronze farthing there lying on your
      table. Who knows; some day, perhaps in a century, that bronze will go to a
      statue of Pavel Shubin, raised in his honour by a grateful posterity!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch leaned on his elbow and stared at the enthusiastic artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a long way off,&rsquo; he said at last with his usual gesture; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re
      speaking of other people, why bring in yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O great philosopher of the Russian world!&rsquo; cried Shubin, &lsquo;every word of
      yours is worth its weight in gold, and it&rsquo;s not to me but to you a statue
      ought to be raised, and I would undertake it. There, as you are lying now,
      in that pose; one doesn&rsquo;t know which is uppermost in it, sloth or
      strength! That&rsquo;s how I would cast you in bronze. You aimed a just reproach
      at my egoism and vanity! Yes! yes! it&rsquo;s useless talking of one&rsquo;s-self;
      it&rsquo;s useless bragging. We have no one yet, no men, look where you will.
      Everywhere&mdash;either small fry, nibblers, Hamlets on a small scale,
      self-absorbed, or darkness and subterranean chaos, or idle babblers and
      wooden sticks. Or else they are like this: they study themselves to the
      most shameful detail, and are for ever feeling the pulse of every
      sensation and reporting to themselves: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I feel, that&rsquo;s what I
      think.&rdquo; A useful, rational occupation! No, if we only had some sensible
      men among us, that girl, that delicate soul, would not have run away from
      us, would not have slipped off like a fish to the water! What&rsquo;s the
      meaning of it, Uvar Ivanovitch? When will our time come? When will men be
      born among us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give us time,&rsquo; answered Uvar Ivanovitch; &lsquo;they will be&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They will be? soil of our country! force of the black earth! thou hast
      said: they will be. Look, I will write down your words. But why are you
      putting out the candle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to sleep; good-bye.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shubin had spoken truly. The unexpected news of Elena&rsquo;s marriage nearly
      killed Anna Vassilyevna. She took to her bed. Nikolai Artemyevitch
      insisted on her not admitting her daughter to her presence; he seemed to
      be enjoying the opportunity of showing himself in the fullest sense the
      master of the house, with all the authority of the head of the family; he
      made an incessant uproar in the household, storming at the servants, and
      constantly saying: &lsquo;I will show you who I am, I will let you know&mdash;you
      wait a little!&rsquo; While he was in the house, Anna Vassilyevna did not see
      Elena, and had to be content with Zoya, who waited on her very devotedly,
      but kept thinking to herself: &lsquo;<i>Diesen Insarof vorziehen&mdash;und wem?</i>&rsquo; 
      But directly Nikolai Artemyevitch went out&mdash;and that happened pretty
      often, Augustina Christianovna had come back in sober earnest&mdash;Elena
      went to her mother, and a long time her mother gazed at her in silence and
      in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dumb reproach, more deeply than any other, cut Elena to the heart; at
      such moments she felt, not remorse, but a deep, boundless pity akin to
      remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mamma, dear mamma!&rsquo; she would repeat, kissing her hands; &lsquo;what was I to
      do? I&rsquo;m not to blame, I loved him, I could not have acted differently.
      Throw the blame on fate for throwing me with a man whom papa doesn&rsquo;t like,
      and who is taking me away from you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; Anna Vassilyevna cut her short, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t remind me of that. When I
      think where you mean to go, my heart is ready to burst!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear mamma,&rsquo; answered Elena, &lsquo;be comforted; at least, it might have been
      worse; I might have died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, as it is, I don&rsquo;t expect to see you again. Either you will end your
      days there in a tent somewhere&rsquo;&mdash;Anna Vassilyevna pictured Bulgaria
      as something after the nature of the Siberian swamps,&mdash;&lsquo;or I shall
      not survive the separation&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, mamma dearest, we shall see each other again, please God.
      There are towns in Bulgaria just as there are here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fine towns there, indeed! There is war going on there now; wherever you
      go, I suppose they are firing cannons off all the while... Are you meaning
      to set off soon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Soon... if only papa. He means to appeal to the authorities; he threatens
      to separate us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna turned her eyes heavenwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Lenotchka, he will not do that. I would not myself have consented to
      this marriage. I would have died first; but what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone,
      and I will not let my daughter be disgraced.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So passed a few days. At last Anna Vassilyevna plucked up her courage, and
      one evening she shut herself up alone with her husband in her room. The
      whole house was hushed to catch every sound. At first nothing was to be
      heard; then Nikolai Artemyevitch&rsquo;s voice began to tune up, then a quarrel
      broke out, shouts were raised, even groans were discerned.... Already
      Shubin was plotting with the maids and Zoya to rush in to the rescue; but
      the uproar in the bedroom began by degrees to grow less, passed into quiet
      talk, and ceased. Only from time to time a faint sob was to be heard, and
      then those, too, were still. There was the jingling of keys, the creak of
      a bureau being unfastened.... The door was opened, and Nikolai
      Artemyevitch appeared. He looked surlily at every one who met him, and
      went out to the club; while Anna Vassilyevna sent for Elena, embraced her
      warmly, and, with bitter tears flowing down her cheeks, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything is settled, he will not make a scandal, and there is nothing
      now to hinder you from going&mdash;from abandoning us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will let Dmitri come to thank you?&rsquo; Elena begged her mother, as soon
      as the latter had been restored a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little, my darling, I cannot bear yet to see the man who has come
      between us. We shall have time before you go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before we go,&rsquo; repeated Elena mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nikolai Artemyevitch had consented &lsquo;not to make a scandal,&rsquo; but Anna
      Vassilyevna did not tell her daughter what a price he had put on his
      consent. She did not tell her that she had promised to pay all his debts,
      and had given him a thousand roubles down on the spot. Moreover, he had
      declared decisively to Anna Vassilyevna that he had no wish to meet
      Insarov, whom he persisted in calling &lsquo;the Montenegrin vagrant,&rsquo; and when
      he got to the club, he began, quite without occasion, talking of Elena&rsquo;s
      marriage, to his partner at cards, a retired general of engineers. &lsquo;You
      have heard,&rsquo; he observed with a show of carelessness, &lsquo;my daughter,
      through the higher education, has gone and married a student.&rsquo; The general
      looked at him through his spectacles, muttered, &lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; and asked him what
      stakes would he play for.

      The day of departure drew near. November was already over; the latest date
      for starting had come. Insarov had long ago made his preparations, and was
      burning with anxiety to get out of Moscow as soon as possible. And the
      doctor was urging him on. &lsquo;You need a warm climate,&rsquo; he told him; &lsquo;you
      will not get well here.&rsquo; Elena, too, was fretting with impatience; she was
      worried by Insarov&rsquo;s pallor, and his emaciation. She often looked with
      involuntary terror at his changed face. Her position in her parents&rsquo; house
      had become insupportable. Her mother mourned over her, as over the dead,
      while her father treated her with contemptuous coldness; the approaching
      separation secretly pained him too, but he regarded it as his duty&mdash;the
      duty of an offended father&mdash;to disguise his feelings, his weakness.
      Anna Vassilyevna at last expressed a wish to see Insarov. He was taken up
      to her secretly by the back stairs. After he had entered her room, for a
      long time she could not speak to him, she could not even bring herself to
      look at him; he sat down near her chair, and waited, with quiet
      respectfulness, for her first word. Elena sat down close, and held her
      mother&rsquo;s hand in hers. At last Anna Vassilyevna raised her eyes, saying:
      &lsquo;God is your judge, Dmitri Nikanorovitch&rsquo;&mdash;she stopped short: the
      reproaches died away on her lips. &lsquo;Why, you are ill,&rsquo; she cried: &lsquo;Elena,
      your husband&rsquo;s ill!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been unwell, Anna Vassilyevna,&rsquo; answered Insarov; &lsquo;and even now I
      am not quite strong yet: but I hope my native air will make me perfectly
      well again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah&mdash;Bulgaria!&rsquo; murmured Anna Vassilyevna, and she thought: &lsquo;Good
      God, a Bulgarian, and dying; a voice as hollow as a drum; and eyes like
      saucers, a perfect skeleton; his coat hanging loose on his shoulders, his
      face as yellow as a guinea, and she&rsquo;s his wife&mdash;she loves him&mdash;it
      must be a bad dream. But&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; she checked herself at once:
      &lsquo;Dmitri Nikanorovitch,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;are you absolutely, absolutely bound to
      go away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Absolutely, Anna Vassilyevna.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Dmitri Nikanorovitch, God grant you never have to go through what I
      am going through now. But you will promise me to take care of her&mdash;to
      love her. You will not have to face poverty while I am living!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears choked her voice. She opened her arms, and Elena and Insarov flung
      themselves into her embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal day had come at last. It had been arranged that Elena should say
      good-bye to her parents at home, and should start on the journey from
      Insarov&rsquo;s lodgings. The departure was fixed for twelve o&rsquo;clock. About a
      quarter of an hour before the appointed time Bersenyev arrived. He had
      expected to find Insarov&rsquo;s compatriots at his lodgings, anxious to see him
      off; but they had already gone before; and with them the two mysterious
      persons known to the reader (they had been witnesses at Insarov&rsquo;s
      wedding). The tailor met the &lsquo;kind gentlemen&rsquo; with a bow; he, presumably,
      to drown his grief, but possibly to celebrate his delight at getting the
      furniture, had been drinking heavily; his wife soon led him away. In the
      room everything was by this time ready; a trunk, tied up with cord, stood
      on the floor. Bersenyev sank into thought: many memories came rushing upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve o&rsquo;clock had long ago struck; and the driver had already brought
      round the horses, but the &lsquo;young people&rsquo; still did not appear. At last
      hurrying steps were heard on the stairs, and Elena came out escorted by
      Insarov and Shubin. Elena&rsquo;s eyes were red; she had left her mother lying
      unconscious; the parting had been terrible. Elena had not seen Bersenyev
      for more than a week: he had been seldom of late at the Stahovs&rsquo;. She had
      not expected to meet him; and crying, &lsquo;You! thank you!&rsquo; she threw herself
      on his neck; Insarov, too, embraced him. A painful silence followed. What
      could these three say to one another? what were they feeling in their
      hearts? Shubin realised the necessity of cutting short everything painful
      with light words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our trio has come together again,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;for the last time. Let us
      submit to the decrees of fate; speak of the past with kindness; and in
      God&rsquo;s name go forward to the new life! In God&rsquo;s name, on our distant way,&rsquo; 
      he began to hum, and stopped short. He felt suddenly ashamed and awkward.
      It is a sin to sing where the dead are lying: and at that instant, in that
      room, the past of which he had spoken was dying, the past of the people
      met together in it. It was dying to be born again in a new life&mdash;doubtless&mdash;still
      it was death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, Elena,&rsquo; began Insarov, turning to his wife, &lsquo;I think everything is
      done? Everything paid, and everything packed. There&rsquo;s nothing more except
      to take the box down.&rsquo; He called his landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tailor came into the room, together with his wife and daughter. He
      listened, slightly reeling, to Insarov&rsquo;s instructions, dragged the box up
      on to his shoulders, and ran quickly down the staircases, tramping heavily
      with his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, after the Russian custom, we must sit down,&rsquo; observed Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all sat down; Bersenyev seated himself on the old sofa, Elena sat
      next him; the landlady and her daughter squatted in the doorway. All were
      silent; all smiled constrainedly, though no one knew why he was smiling;
      each of them wanted to say something at parting, and each (except, of
      course, the landlady and her daughter, they were simply rolling their
      eyes) felt that at such moments it is only permissible to utter
      common-places, that any word of importance, of sense, or even of deep
      feeling, would be somehow out of place, almost insincere. Insarov was the
      first to get up, and he began crossing himself. &lsquo;Farewell, our little
      room!&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came kisses, the sounding but cold kisses of leave-taking, good
      wishes&mdash;half expressed&mdash;for the journey, promises to write, the
      last, half-smothered words of farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena, all in tears, had already taken her seat in the sledge; Insarov had
      carefully wrapped her feet up in a rug; Shubin, Bersenyev, the landlord,
      his wife, the little daughter, with the inevitable kerchief on her head,
      the doorkeeper, a workman in a striped bedgown, were all standing on the
      steps, when suddenly a splendid sledge, harnessed with spirited horses,
      flew into the courtyard, and from the sledge, shaking the snow off the
      collar of his cloak, leapt Nikolai Artemyevitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not too late, thank God,&rsquo; he cried, running up to their sledge.
      &lsquo;Here, Elena, is our last parental benediction,&rsquo; he said, bending down
      under the hood, and taking from his pocket a little holy image, sewn in a
      velvet bag, he put it round her neck. She began to sob, and kiss his
      hands; and the coachman meantime pulled out of the forepart of the sledge
      a half bottle of champagne, and three glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said Nikolai Artemyevitch&mdash;and his own tears were trickling
      on to the beaver collar of his cloak&mdash;&lsquo;we must drink to&mdash;good
      journey&mdash;good wishes&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; He began pouring out the
      champagne: his hands were shaking, the foam rose over the edge and fell on
      to the snow. He took one glass, and gave the other two to Elena and
      Insarov, who by now was seated beside hen &lsquo;God give you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
      began Nikolai Artemyevitch, and he could not go on: he drank off the wine;
      they, too, drank off their glasses. &lsquo;Now you should drink, gentlemen,&rsquo; he
      added, turning to Shubin and Bersenyev, but at that instant the driver
      started the horses. Nikolai Artemyevitch ran beside the sledge. &lsquo;Mind and
      write to us,&rsquo; he said in a broken voice. Elena put out her head, saying:
      &lsquo;Good-bye, papa, Andrei Petrovitch, Pavel Yakovlitch, good-bye all,
      good-bye, Russia!&rsquo; and dropped back in her place. The driver flourished
      his whip, and gave a whistle; the sledge, its runners crunching on the
      snow, turned out of the gates to the right and disappeared.

    <h2>
      XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a bright April day. On the broad lagoon which separates Venice from
      the narrow strip of accumulated sea sand, called the Lido, a gondola was
      gliding&mdash;swaying rhythmically at every push made by the gondolier as
      he leaned on the big pole. Under its low awning, on soft leather cushions,
      were sitting Elena and Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena&rsquo;s features had not changed much since the day of her departure from
      Moscow, but their expression was different; it was more thoughtful and
      more severe, and her eyes had a bolder look. Her whole figure had grown
      finer and more mature, and the hair seemed to lie in greater thickness and
      luxuriance along her white brow and her fresh cheeks. Only about her lips,
      when she was not smiling, a scarcely perceptible line showed the presence
      of a hidden constant anxiety. In Insarov&rsquo;s face, on the contrary, the
      expression had remained the same, but his features had undergone a cruel
      change. He had grown thin, old, pale and bent; he was constantly coughing
      a short dry cough, and his sunken eyes shone with a strange brilliance. On
      the way from Russia, Insarov had lain ill for almost two months at Vienna,
      and only at the end of March had he been able to come with his wife to
      Venice; from there he was hoping to make his way through Zara to Servia,
      to Bulgaria; the other roads were closed. The war was now at its height
      about the Danube; England and France had declared war on Russia, all the
      Slavonic countries were roused and were preparing for an uprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondola put in to the inner shore of the Lido. Elena and Insarov
      walked along the narrow sandy road planted with sickly trees (every year
      they plant them and every year they die) to the outer shore of the Lido,
      to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along the beach. The Adriatic rolled its muddy-blue waves
      before them; they raced into the shore, foaming and hissing, and drew back
      again, leaving fine shells and fragments of seaweed on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a desolate place!&rsquo; observed Elena &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too cold for you
      here, but I guess why you wanted to come here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cold!&rsquo; rejoined Insarov with a rapid and bitter smile, &lsquo;I shall be a fine
      soldier, if I&rsquo;m to be afraid of the cold. I came here... I will tell you
      why. I look across that sea, and I feel as though here, I am nearer my
      country. It is there, you know,&rsquo; he added, stretching out his hand to the
      East, &lsquo;the wind blows from there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will not this wind bring the ship you are expecting?&rsquo; said Elena. &lsquo;See,
      there is a white sail, is not that it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov gazed seaward into the distance to where Elena was pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renditch promised to arrange everything for us within a week,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;we can rely on him, I think.... Did you hear, Elena,&rsquo; he added with
      sudden animation, &lsquo;they say the poor Dalmatian fishermen have sacrificed
      their dredging weights&mdash;you know the leads they weigh their nets with
      for letting them down to the bottom&mdash;to make bullets! They have no
      money, they only just live by fishing; but they have joyfully given up
      their last property, and now are starving. What a nation!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Aufgepasst</i>!&rsquo; shouted a haughty voice behind them. The heavy thud
      of horse&rsquo;s hoofs was heard, and an Austrian officer in a short grey tunic
      and a green cap galloped past them&mdash;they had scarcely time to get out
      of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov looked darkly after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was not to blame,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;you know, they have no other place
      where they can ride.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was not to blame,&rsquo; answered Insarov &lsquo;but he made my blood boil with
      his shout, his moustaches, his cap, his whole appearance. Let us go back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, let us go back, Dmitri. It&rsquo;s really cold here. You did not take care
      of yourself after your Moscow illness, and you had to pay for that at
      Vienna. Now you must be more cautious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov did not answer, but the same bitter smile passed over his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you like,&rsquo; Elena went on, &lsquo;we will go along to the Canal Grande. We
      have not seen Venice properly, you know, all the while we have been here.
      And in the evening we are going to the theatre; I have two tickets for the
      stalls. They say there&rsquo;s a new opera being given. If you like, we will
      give up to-day to one another; we will forget politics and war and
      everything, we will forget everything but that we are alive, breathing,
      thinking together; that we are one for ever&mdash;would you like that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you would like it, Elena,&rsquo; answered Insarov, &lsquo;it follows that I should
      like it too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew that,&rsquo; observed Elena with a smile, &lsquo;come, let us go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back to the gondola, took their seats, told the gondolier to
      take them without hurry along the Canal Grande.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who has not seen Venice in April knows all the unutterable
      fascinations of that magic town. The softness and mildness of spring
      harmonise with Venice, just as the glaring sun of summer suits the
      magnificence of Genoa, and as the gold and purple of autumn suits the
      grand antiquity of Rome. The beauty of Venice, like the spring, touches
      the soul and moves it to desire; it frets and tortures the inexperienced
      heart like the promise of a coming bliss, mysterious but not elusive.
      Everything in it is bright, and everything is wrapt in a drowsy, tangible
      mist, as it were, of the hush of love; everything in it is so silent, and
      everything in it is kindly; everything in it is feminine, from its name
      upwards. It has well been given the name of &lsquo;the fair city.&rsquo; Its masses of
      palaces and churches stand out light and wonderful like the graceful dream
      of a young god; there is something magical, something strange and
      bewitching in the greenish-grey light and silken shimmer of the silent
      water of the canals, in the noiseless gliding of the gondolas, in the
      absence of the coarse din of a town, the coarse rattling, and crashing,
      and uproar. &lsquo;Venice is dead, Venice is deserted,&rsquo; her citizens will tell
      you, but perhaps this last charm&mdash;the charm of decay&mdash;was not
      vouchsafed her in the very heyday of the flower and majesty of her beauty.
      He who has not seen her, knows her not; neither Canaletto nor Guardi (to
      say nothing of later painters) has been able to convey the silvery
      tenderness of the atmosphere, the horizon so close, yet so elusive, the
      divine harmony of exquisite lines and melting colours. One who has
      outlived his life, who has been crushed by it, should not visit Venice;
      she will be cruel to him as the memory of unfulfilled dreams of early
      days; but sweet to one whose strength is at its full, who is conscious of
      happiness; let him bring his bliss under her enchanted skies; and however
      bright it may be, Venice will make it more golden with her unfading
      splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gondola in which Insarov and Elena were sitting passed <i>Riva dei
      Schiavoni</i>, the palace of the Doges, and Piazzetta, and entered the
      Grand Canal. On both sides stretched marble palaces; they seemed to float
      softly by, scarcely letting the eye seize or absorb their beauty. Elena
      felt herself deeply happy; in the perfect blue of her heavens there was
      only one dark cloud&mdash;and it was in the far distance; Insarov was much
      better that day. They glided as far as the acute angle of the Rialto and
      turned back. Elena was afraid of the chill of the churches for Insarov;
      but she remembered the academy delle Belle Arti, and told the gondolier to
      go towards it. They quickly walked through all the rooms of that little
      museum. Being neither connoisseurs nor dilettantes, they did not stop
      before every picture; they put no constraint on themselves; a spirit of
      light-hearted gaiety came over them. Everything seemed suddenly very
      entertaining. (Children know this feeling very well.) To the great scandal
      of three English visitors, Elena laughed till she cried over the St Mark
      of Tintoretto, skipping down from the sky like a frog into the water, to
      deliver the tortured slave; Insarov in his turn fell into raptures over
      the back and legs of the sturdy man in the green cloak, who stands in the
      foreground of Titian&rsquo;s Ascension and holds his arms outstretched after the
      Madonna; but the Madonna&mdash;a splendid, powerful woman, calmly and
      majestically making her way towards the bosom of God the Father&mdash;impressed
      both Insarov and Elena; they liked, too, the austere and reverent painting
      of the elder Cima da Conegliano. As they were leaving the academy, they
      took another look at the Englishmen behind them&mdash;with their long
      rabbit-like teeth and drooping whiskers&mdash;and laughed; they glanced at
      their gondolier with his abbreviated jacket and short breeches&mdash;and
      laughed; they caught sight of a woman selling old clothes with a knob of
      grey hair on the very top of her head&mdash;and laughed more than ever;
      they looked into one another&rsquo;s face&mdash;and went off into peals of
      laughter, and directly they had sat down in the gondola, they clasped each
      other&rsquo;s hand in a close, close grip. They reached their hotel, ran into
      their room, and ordered dinner to be brought in. Their gaiety did not
      desert them at dinner. They pressed each other to eat, drank to the health
      of their friends in Moscow, clapped their hands at the waiter for a
      delicious dish of fish, and kept asking him for live <i>frutti di mare</i>;
      the waiter shrugged his shoulders and scraped with his feet, but when he
      had left them, he shook his head and once even muttered with a sigh, <i>poveretti</i>!
      (poor things!) After dinner they set off for the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were giving an opera of Verdi&rsquo;s, which though, honestly speaking,
      rather vulgar, has already succeeded in making the round of all the
      European theatres, an opera, well-known among Russians, <i>La Traviata</i>.
      The season in Venice was over, and none of the singers rose above the
      level of mediocrity; every one shouted to the best of their abilities. The
      part of Violetta was performed by an artist, of no renown, and judging by
      the cool reception given her by the public, not a favourite, but she was
      not destitute of talent. She was a young, and not very pretty, black-eyed
      girl with an unequal and already overstrained voice. Her dress was
      ill-chosen and naively gaudy; her hair was hidden in a red net, her dress
      of faded blue satin was too tight for her, and thick Swedish gloves
      reached up to her sharp elbows. Indeed, how could she, the daughter of
      some Bergamese shepherd, know how Parisian <i>dames aux camelias</i>
      dress! And she did not understand how to move on the stage; but there was
      much truth and artless simplicity in her acting, and she sang with that
      passion of expression and rhythm which is only vouchsafed to Italians.
      Elena and Insarov were sitting alone together in a dark box close to the
      stage; the mirthful mood which had come upon them in the academy <i>delle
      Belle Arti</i> had not yet passed off. When the father of the unhappy
      young man who had fallen into the snares of the enchantress came on to the
      stage in a yellow frock-coat and a dishevelled white wig, opened his mouth
      awry, and losing his presence of mind before he had begun, only brought
      out a faint bass <i>tremolo</i>, they almost burst into laughter. ... But
      Violetta&rsquo;s acting impressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They hardly clap that poor girl at all,&rsquo; said Elena, &lsquo;but I like her a
      thousand times better than some conceited second-rate celebrity who would
      grimace and attitudinise all the while for effect. This girl seems as
      though it were all in earnest; look, she pays no attention to the public.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov bent over the edge of the box, and looked attentively at Violetta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he commented, &lsquo;she is in earnest; she&rsquo;s on the brink of the grave
      herself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena was mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third act began. The curtain rose&mdash;Elena shuddered at the sight
      of the bed, the drawn curtains, the glass of medicine, the shaded lamps.
      She recalled the near past. &lsquo;What of the future? What of the present?&rsquo; 
      flashed across her mind. As though in response to her thought, the
      artist&rsquo;s mimic cough on the stage was answered in the box by the hoarse,
      terribly real cough of Insarov. Elena stole a glance at him, and at once
      gave her features a calm and untroubled expression; Insarov understood
      her, and he began himself to smile, and softly to hum the tune of the
      song.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was soon quiet. Violetta&rsquo;s acting became steadily better, and
      freer. She had thrown aside everything subsidiary, everything superfluous,
      and <i>found herself</i>; a rare, a lofty delight for an artist! She had
      suddenly crossed the limit, which it is impossible to define, beyond which
      is the abiding place of beauty. The audience was thrilled and astonished.
      The plain girl with the broken voice began to get a hold on it, to master
      it. And the singer&rsquo;s voice even did not sound broken now; it had gained
      mellowness and strength. Alfredo made his entrance; Violetta&rsquo;s cry of
      happiness almost raised that storm in the audience known as <i>fanatisme</i>,
      beside which all the applause of our northern audiences is nothing. A
      brief interval passed&mdash;and again the audience were in transports. The
      duet began, the best thing in the opera, in which the composer has
      succeeded in expressing all the pathos of the senseless waste of youth,
      the final struggle of despairing, helpless love. Caught up and carried
      along by the general sympathy, with tears of artistic delight and real
      suffering in her eyes, the singer let herself be borne along on the wave
      of passion within her; her face was transfigured, and in the presence of
      the threatening signs of fast approaching death, the words: &lsquo;<i>Lascia mi
      vivero&mdash;morir si giovane</i>&rsquo; (let me live&mdash;to die so young!)
      burst from her in such a tempest of prayer rising to heaven, that the
      whole theatre shook with frenzied applause and shouts of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena felt cold all over. Softly her hand sought Insarov&rsquo;s, found it, and
      clasped it tightly. He responded to its pressure; but she did not look at
      him, nor he at her. Very different was the clasp of hands with which they
      had greeted each other in the gondola a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again they glided along the Canal Grande towards their hotel. Night had
      set in now, a clear, soft night. The same palaces met them, but they
      seemed different. Those that were lighted up by the moon shone with pale
      gold, and in this pale light all details of ornaments and lines of windows
      and balconies seemed lost; they stood out more clearly in the buildings
      that were wrapped in a light veil of unbroken shadow. The gondolas, with
      their little red lamps, seemed to flit past more noiselessly and swiftly
      than ever; their steel beaks flashed mysteriously, mysteriously their oars
      rose and fell over the ripples stirred by little silvery fish; here and
      there was heard the brief, subdued call of a gondolier (they never sing
      now); scarcely another sound was to be heard. The hotel where Insarov and
      Elena were staying was on the <i>Riva dei Schiavoni</i>; before they
      reached it they left the gondola, and walked several times round the
      Square of St. Mark, under the arches, where numbers of holiday makers were
      gathered before the tiny cafes. There is a special sweetness in wandering
      alone with one you love, in a strange city among strangers; everything
      seems beautiful and full of meaning, you feel peace and goodwill to all
      men, you wish all the same happiness that fills your heart. But Elena
      could not now give herself up without a care to the sense of her
      happiness; her heart could not regain its calm after the emotions that had
      so lately shaken it; and Insarov, as he walked by the palace of the Doges,
      pointed without speaking to the mouths of the Austrian cannons, peeping
      out from the lower arches, and pulled his hat down over his eyes. By now
      he felt tired, and, with a last glance at the church of St. Mark, at its
      cupola, where on the bluish lead bright patches of phosphorescent light
      shone in the rays of the moon, they turned slowly homewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their little room looked out on to the lagoon, which stretches from the <i>Riva
      del Schiavoni</i> to the Giudecca. Almost facing their hotel rose the
      slender tower of S. George; high against the sky on the right shone the
      golden ball of the Customs House; and, decked like a bride, stood the
      loveliest of the churches, the <i>Redentore</i> of Palladio; on the left
      were the black masts and rigging of ships, the funnels of steamers; a
      half-furled sail hung in one place like a great wing, and the flags
      scarcely stirred. Insarov sat down at the window, but Elena did not let
      him admire the view for long; he seemed suddenly feverish, he was overcome
      by consuming weakness. She put him to bed, and, waiting till he had fallen
      asleep, she returned to the window. Oh, how still and kindly was the
      night, what dovelike softness breathed in the deep-blue air! Every
      suffering, every sorrow surely must be soothed to slumber under that clear
      sky, under that pure, holy light! &lsquo;O God,&rsquo; thought Elena, &lsquo;why must there
      be death, why is there separation, and disease and tears? or else, why
      this beauty, this sweet feeling of hope, this soothing sense of an abiding
      refuge, an unchanging support, an everlasting protection? What is the
      meaning of this smiling, blessing sky; this happy, sleeping earth? Can it
      be that all that is only in us, and that outside us is eternal cold and
      silence? Can it be that we are alone... alone... and there, on all sides,
      in all those unattainable depths and abysses&mdash;nothing is akin to us;
      all, all is strange and apart from us? Why, then, have we this desire for,
      this delight in prayer?&rsquo; (<i>Morir si giovane</i> was echoing in her
      heart.)... &lsquo;Is it impossible, then, to propitiate, to avert, to save... O
      God! is it impossible to believe in miracle?&rsquo; She dropped her head on to
      her clasped hands. &lsquo;Enough,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;Indeed enough! I have been
      happy not for moments only, not for hours, not for whole days even, but
      for whole weeks together. And what right had I to happiness?&rsquo; She felt
      terror at the thought of her happiness. &lsquo;What, if that cannot be?&rsquo; she
      thought. &lsquo;What, if it is not granted for nothing? Why, it has been
      heaven... and we are mortals, poor sinful mortals.... <i>Morir si giovane</i>.
      Oh, dark omen, away! It&rsquo;s not only for me his life is needed!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what, if it is a punishment,&rsquo; she thought again; &lsquo;what, if we must
      now pay the penalty of our guilt in full? My conscience was silent, it is
      silent now, but is that a proof of innocence? O God, can we be so guilty!
      Canst Thou who hast created this night, this sky, wish to punish us for
      having loved each other? If it be so, if he has sinned, if I have sinned,&rsquo; 
      she added with involuntary force, &lsquo;grant that he, O God, grant that we
      both, may die at least a noble, glorious death&mdash;there, on the plains
      of his country, not here in this dark room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the grief of my poor, lonely mother?&rsquo; she asked herself, and was
      bewildered, and could find no answer to her question. Elena did not know
      that every man&rsquo;s happiness is built on the unhappiness of another, that
      even his advantage, his comfort, like a statue needs a pedestal, the
      disadvantage, the discomfort of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renditch!&rsquo; muttered Insarov in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena went up to him on tiptoe, bent over him, and wiped the perspiration
      from his face. He tossed a little on his pillow, and was still again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went back again to the window, and again her thoughts took possession
      of her. She began to argue with herself, to assure herself that there was
      no reason to be afraid. She even began to feel ashamed of her weakness.
      &lsquo;Is there any danger? isn&rsquo;t he better?&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;Why, if we had not
      been at the theatre to-day, all this would never have entered my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant she saw high above the water a white sea-gull; some
      fisherman had scared it, it seemed, for it flew noiselessly with uncertain
      course, as though seeking a spot where it could alight. &lsquo;Come, if it flies
      here,&rsquo; thought Elena, &lsquo;it will be a good omen.&rsquo; ... The sea-gull flew
      round in a circle, folded its wings, and, as though it had been shot,
      dropped with a plaintive cry in the distance behind a dark ship. Elena
      shuddered; then she was ashamed of having shuddered, and, without
      undressing, she lay down on the bed beside Insarov, who was breathing
      quickly and heavily.

    <h2>
      XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Insarov waked late with a dull pain in his head, and a feeling, as he
      expressed it, of disgusting weakness all over. He got up however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renditch has not come?&rsquo; was his first question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; answered Elena, and she handed him the latest number of the <i>Osservatore
      Triestino</i>, in which there was much upon the war, the Slav Provinces,
      and the Principalities. Insarov began reading it; she busied herself in
      getting some coffee ready for him. Some one knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renditch,&rsquo; both thought at once, but a voice said in Russian, &lsquo;May I come
      in?&rsquo; Elena and Insarov looked at each other in astonishment; and without
      waiting for an answer, an elegantly dressed young man entered the room,
      with a small sharp-featured face, and bright little eyes. He was beaming
      all over, as though he had just won a fortune or heard a most delightful
      piece of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insarov got up from his seat
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t recognise me,&rsquo; began the stranger, going up to him with an easy
      air, and bowing politely to Elena, &lsquo;Lupoyarov, do you remember, we met at
      Moscow at the E&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, at the E&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s,&rsquo; replied Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, to be sure! I beg you to present me to your wife. Madam, I
      have always had the profoundest respect for Dmitri Vassilyevitch&rsquo; (he
      corrected himself)&mdash;&lsquo;for Nikanor Vassilyevitch, and am very happy to
      have the pleasure at last of making your acquaintance. Fancy,&rsquo; he
      continued, turning to Insarov, &lsquo;I only heard yesterday evening that you
      were here. I am staying at this hotel too. What a city! Venice is poetry&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the only word for it! But one thing&rsquo;s really awful: the cursed Austrians
      meeting one at every turn! ah, these Austrians! By the way, have you
      heard, there&rsquo;s been a decisive battle on the Danube: three hundred Turkish
      officers killed, Silistria taken; Servia has declared its independence.
      You, as a patriot, ought to be in transports, oughtn&rsquo;t you? Even my
      Slavonic blood&rsquo;s positively on fire! I advise you to be more careful,
      though; I&rsquo;m convinced there&rsquo;s a watch kept on you. The spies here are
      something awful! A suspicious-looking man came up to me yesterday and
      asked: &ldquo;Are you a Russian?&rdquo; I told him I was a Dane. But you seem unwell,
      dear Nikanor Vassilyevitch. You ought to see a doctor; madam, you ought to
      make your husband see a doctor. Yesterday I ran through the palaces and
      churches, as though I were crazy. I suppose you&rsquo;ve been in the palace of
      the Doges? What magnificence everywhere! Especially that great hall and
      Marino Faliero&rsquo;s place: there&rsquo;s an inscription: <i>decapitati pro
      criminibus</i>. I&rsquo;ve been in the famous prisons too; that threw me into
      indignation, you may fancy. I&rsquo;ve always, you remember perhaps, taken an
      interest in social questions, and taken sides against aristocracy&mdash;well,
      that&rsquo;s where I should like to send the champions of aristocracy&mdash;to
      those dungeons. How well Byron said: <i>I stood in Venice on the Bridge of
      Sighs</i>; though he was an aristocrat too. I was always for progress&mdash;the
      younger generation are all for progress. And what do you say to the
      Anglo-French business? We shall see whether they can do much, Boustrapa
      and Palmerston. You know Palmerston has been made Prime Minister. No, say
      what you like, the Russian fist is not to be despised. He&rsquo;s awfully deep
      that Boustrapa! If you like I will lend you <i>Les Chatiments de Victor
      Hugo</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s marvellous&mdash;<i>L&rsquo;avenir, le gendarme de Dieu</i>&mdash;rather
      boldly written, but what force in it, what force! That was a fine saying,
      too, of Prince Vyazemsky&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Europe repeats: Bash-Kadik-Lar keeping an eye
      on Sinope.&rdquo; I adore poetry. I have Proudhon&rsquo;s last work, too&mdash;I have
      everything. I don&rsquo;t know how you feel, but I&rsquo;m glad of the war; only as
      I&rsquo;m not required at home, I&rsquo;m going from here to Florence, and to Rome.
      France I can&rsquo;t go to&mdash;so I&rsquo;m thinking of Spain&mdash;the women there,
      I&rsquo;m told, are marvellous! only such poverty, and so many insects. I would
      be off to California&mdash;we Russians are ready to do anything&mdash;but
      I promised an editor to study the question of the commerce of the
      Mediterranean in detail. You will say that&rsquo;s an uninteresting, special
      subject, but that&rsquo;s just what we need, specialists; we have philosophised
      enough, now we need the practical, the practical. But you are very unwell,
      Nikanor Vassilyevitch, I am tiring you, perhaps, but still I must stay a
      little longer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And for a long time Lupoyarov still babbled on in the same way, and, as he
      went away, he promised to come again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn out by the unexpected visit, Insarov lay down on the sofa. &lsquo;So this,&rsquo; 
      he said, mournfully looking at Elena, &lsquo;is your younger generation! There
      are plenty who show off, and give themselves airs, while at heart they are
      as empty chatterboxes as that worthy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena made no reply to her husband; at that instant she was far more
      concerned at Insarov&rsquo;s weakness than at the character of the whole younger
      generation in Russia. She sat down near him, and took up some work. He
      closed his eyes, and lay without moving, white and thin. Elena glanced at
      his sharp profile, at his emaciated hands, and felt a sudden pang of
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dmitri,&rsquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started. &lsquo;Eh? Has Renditch come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet&mdash;but what do you think&mdash;you are in a fever, you are
      really not quite well, shouldn&rsquo;t we send for a doctor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That wretched gossip has frightened you. There&rsquo;s no necessity. I will
      rest a little, and it will pass off. After dinner we will go out again&mdash;somewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours passed. Insarov still lay on the sofa, but he could not sleep,
      though he did not open his eyes. Elena did not leave his side; she had
      dropped her work upon her knee, and did not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to sleep?&rsquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little.&rsquo; He took her hand, and placed it under his head. &lsquo;There&mdash;that
      is nice. Wake me at once directly Renditch comes. If he says the ship is
      ready, we will start at once. We ought to pack everything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Packing won&rsquo;t take long,&rsquo; answered Elena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That fellow babbled something about a battle, about Servia,&rsquo; said
      Insarov, after a short interval. &lsquo;I suppose he made it all up. But we
      must, we must start. We can&rsquo;t lose time. Be ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell asleep, and everything was still in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena let her head rest against the back of her chair, and gazed a long
      while out of the window. The weather had changed for the worse; the wind
      had risen. Great white clouds were scudding over the sky, a slender mast
      was swaying in the distance, a long streamer, with a red cross on it, kept
      fluttering, falling, and fluttering again. The pendulum of the
      old-fashioned clock ticked drearily, with a kind of melancholy whirr.
      Elena shut her eyes. She had slept badly all night; gradually she, too,
      fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a strange dream. She thought sha was floating in a boat on the
      Tsaritsino lake with some unknown people. They did not speak, but sat
      motionless, no one was rowing; the boat was moving by itself. Elena was
      not afraid, but she felt dreary; she wanted to know who were these people,
      and why she was with them? She looked and the lake grew broader, the banks
      vanished&mdash;now it was not a lake but a stormy sea: immense blue silent
      waves rocked the boat majestically; something menacing, roaring was rising
      from the depths; her unknown companions jumped up, shrieking, wringing
      their hands... Elena recognised their faces; her father was among them.
      But a kind of white whirlwind came flying over the waves&mdash;everything
      was turning round, everything was confounded together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked about her; as before, all around was white; but it was snow,
      snow, boundless plains of snow. And she was not now in a boat, but
      travelling, as she had come from Moscow, in a sledge; she was not alone;
      by her side was sitting a little creature muffled in an old cloak; Elena
      looked closely; it was Katya, her poor little friend. Elena was seized
      with terror. &lsquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t she dead?&rsquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Katya, where are we going together?&rsquo; Katya did not answer, and nestled
      herself closer in her little cloak; she was freezing. Elena too was cold;
      she looked along the road into the distance; far away a town could be seen
      through the fine drifting snow. High white towers with silvery cupolas...
      &lsquo;Katya, Katya, is it Moscow? No,&rsquo; thought Elena, &lsquo;it is Solovetsky
      Monastery; it&rsquo;s full of little narrow cells like a beehive; it&rsquo;s stifling,
      cramping there&mdash;and Dmitri&rsquo;s shut up there. I must rescue him.&rsquo;...
      Suddenly a grey, yawning abyss opened before her. The sledge was falling,
      Katya was laughing. &lsquo;Elena, Elena!&rsquo; came a voice from the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena!&rsquo; sounded distinctly in her ears. She raised her head quickly,
      turned round, and was stupefied: Insarov, white as snow, the snow of her
      dream, had half risen from the sofa, and was staring at her with large,
      bright, dreadful eyes. His hair hung in disorder on his forehead and his
      lips parted strangely. Horror, mingled with an anguish of tenderness, was
      expressed on his suddenly transfigured face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Elena!&rsquo; he articulated, &lsquo;I am dying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell with a scream on her knees, and clung to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rsquo; repeated Insarov: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m dying... Good-bye, my poor girl!
      good-bye, my country!&rsquo; and he fell backwards on to the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena rushed out of the room, began calling for help; a waiter ran for a
      doctor. Elena clung to Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant in the doorway appeared a broad-shouldered, sunburnt man,
      in a stout frieze coat and a low oil-skin hat. He stood still in
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Renditch!&rsquo; cried Elena, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s you! Look, for God&rsquo;s sake, he&rsquo;s ill! What&rsquo;s
      wrong? Good God! He went out yesterday, he was talking to me just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renditch said nothing and only moved on one side. There slipped quickly
      past him a little figure in a wig and spectacles; it was a doctor living
      in the same hotel. He went up to Insarov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Signora,&rsquo; he said, after the lapse of a few minutes, &lsquo;the foreign
      gentleman is dead&mdash;<i>il Signore forestiere e morte</i>&mdash;of
      aneurism in combination with disease of the lungs.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day, in the same room, Renditch was standing at the window;
      before him, wrapped in a shawl, sat Elena. In the next room, Insarov lay
      in his coffin. Elena&rsquo;s face was both scared and lifeless; two lines could
      be seen on her forehead between her eyebrows; they gave a strained
      expression to her fixed eyes. In the window lay an open letter from Anna
      Vassilyevna. She begged her daughter to come to Moscow if only for a
      month, complained of her loneliness, and of Nikolai Artemyevitch, sent
      greetings to Insarov, inquired after his health, and begged him to spare
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renditch was a Dalmatian, a sailor, with whom Insarov had become
      acquainted during his wanderings in his own country, and whom he had
      sought out in Venice. He was a dry, gruff man, full of daring and devoted
      to the Slavonic cause. He despised the Turks and hated the Austrians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How long must you remain at Venice?&rsquo; Elena asked him in Italian. And her
      voice was as lifeless as her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One day for freighting and not to rouse suspicions, and then straight to
      Zara. I shall have sad news for our countrymen. They have long been
      expecting him; they rested their hopes on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They rested their hopes on him,&rsquo; Elena repeated mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When will you bury him?&rsquo; asked Renditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena not at once replied, &lsquo;To-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow? I will stop; I should like to throw a handful of earth into
      his grave. And you will want help. But it would have been better for him
      to lie in Slavonic earth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Elena looked at Renditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;take me and him and carry us across to the other
      side of the sea, away from here. Isn&rsquo;t that possible?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renditch considered: &lsquo;Possible certainly, but difficult. We shall have to
      come into collision with the damned authorities here. But supposing we
      arrange all that and bury him there, how am I to bring you back?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need not bring me back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? where will you stop?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall find some place for myself; only take us, take me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Renditch scratched the back of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know best; but it&rsquo;s all very difficult. I will, I will try; and you
      expect me here in two hours&rsquo; time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away. Elena passed into the next room, leaned against the wall,
      and for a long time stood there as though turned to stone. Then she
      dropped on her knees, but she could not pray. There was no reproach in her
      heart; she did not dare to question God&rsquo;s will, to ask why He had not
      spared, pitied, saved, why He had punished her beyond her guilt, if she
      were guilty. Each of us is guilty by the fact that he lives; and there is
      no one so great a thinker, so great a benefactor of mankind that he might
      hope to have a right to live for the service he has done.... Still Elena
      could not pray; she was a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night a broad-bottomed boat put off from the hotel where the
      Insarovs lived. In the boat sat Elena with Renditch and beside them stood
      a long box covered with a black cloth. They rowed for about an hour, and
      at last reached a small two-masted ship, which was riding at anchor at the
      very entrance of the harbour. Elena and Renditch got into the ship; the
      sailors carried in the box. At midnight a storm had arisen, but early in
      the morning the ship had passed out of the Lido. During the day the storm
      raged with fearful violence, and experienced seamen in Lloyd&rsquo;s offices
      shook their heads and prophesied no good. The Adriatic Sea between Venice,
      Trieste, and the Dalmatian coast is particularly dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks after Elena&rsquo;s departure from Vienna, Anna Vassilyevna received
      the following letter in Moscow:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My DEAR PARENTS.&mdash;I am saying goodbye to you for ever. You will
      never see me again. Dmitri died yesterday. Everything is over for me.
      To-day I am setting off with his body to Zara. I will bury him, and what
      will become of me, I don&rsquo;t know. But now I have no country but Dmitri&rsquo;s
      country. There, they are preparing for revolution, they are getting ready
      for war. I will join the Sisters of Mercy; I will tend the sick and the
      wounded. I don&rsquo;t know what will become of me, but even after Dmitri&rsquo;s
      death, I will be faithful to his memory, to the work of his whole life. I
      have learnt Bulgarian and Servian. Very likely, I shall not have strength
      to live through it all for long&mdash;so much the better. I have been
      brought to the edge of the precipice and I must fall over. Fate did not
      bring us together for nothing; who knows?&mdash;perhaps I killed him; now
      it is his turn to draw me after him. I sought happiness, and I shall find&mdash;perhaps
      death. It seems it was to be thus: it seems it was a sin.... But death
      covers all and reconciles all; does it not? Forgive me all the suffering I
      have caused you; it was not under my control. But how could I return to
      Russia; What have I to do in Russia?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Accept my last kisses and blessings, and do not condemn me.
    </p>
    <p>
      R.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly five years have passed since then, and no further news of Elena has
      come. All letters and inquiries were fruitless; in vain did Nikolai
      Artemyevitch himself make a journey to Venice and to Zara after peace was
      concluded. In Venice he learnt what is already known to the reader, but in
      Zara no one could give him any positive information about Renditch and the
      ship he had taken. There were dark rumours that some years back, after a
      great storm, the sea had thrown up on shore a coffin in which had been
      found a man&rsquo;s body... But according to other more trustworthy accounts
      this coffin had not been thrown up by the sea at all, but had been carried
      over and buried near the shore by a foreign lady, coming from Venice; some
      added that they had seen this lady afterwards in Herzegovina, with the
      forces which were there assembled; they even described her dress, black
      from head to foot However it was, all trace of Elena had disappeared
      beyond recovery for ever; and no one knows whether she is still living,
      whether she is hidden away somewhere, or whether the petty drama of life
      is over&mdash;the little ferment of her existence is at an end; and she
      has found death in her turn. It happens at times that a man wakes up and
      asks himself with involuntary horror, &lsquo;Can I be already thirty ...
      forty... fifty? How is it life has passed so soon? How is it death has
      moved up so close?&rsquo; Death is like a fisher who catches fish in his net and
      leaves them for a while in the water; the fish is still swimming but the
      net is round him, and the fisher will draw him up&mdash;when he thinks
      fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      What became of the other characters of our story?
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Vassilyevna is still living; she has aged very much since the blow
      that has fallen on her; is less complaining, but far more wretched.
      Nikolai Artemyevitch, too, has grown older and greyer, and has parted from
      Augustina Christianovna.... He has taken now to abusing everything
      foreign. His housekeeper, a handsome woman of thirty, a Russian, wears
      silk dresses and gold rings and bracelets. Kurnatovsky, like every man of
      ardent temperament and dark complexion, a devoted admirer of pretty
      blondes, married Zoya; she is in complete subjection to him and has even
      given up thinking in German. Bersenyev is in Heidelberg; he has been sent
      abroad at the expense of government; he has visited Berlin and Paris and
      is not wasting his time; he has become a thoroughly efficient professor.
      The attention of the learned public has been caught by his two articles:
      &lsquo;On some peculiarities of ancient law as regards judicial sentences,&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;On the significance of cities in civilisation.&rsquo; It is only a pity that
      both articles are written in rather a heavy style, disfigured by foreign
      words. Shubin is in Rome; he is completely given up to his art and is
      reckoned one of the most remarkable and promising of young sculptors.
      Severe tourists consider that he has not sufficiently studied the antique,
      that he has &lsquo;no style,&rsquo; and reckon him one of the French school; he has
      had a great many orders from the English and Americans. Of late, there has
      been much talk about a Bacchante of his; the Russian Count Boboshkin, the
      well-known millionaire, thought of buying it for one thousand scudi, but
      decided in preference to give three thousand to another sculptor, French
      <i>pur sang</i>, for a group entitled, &lsquo;A youthful shepherdess dying for
      love in the bosom of the Genius of Spring.&rsquo; Shubin writes from time to
      time to Uvar Ivanovitch, who alone has remained quite unaltered in all
      respects. &lsquo;Do you remember,&rsquo; he wrote to him lately, &lsquo;what you said to me
      that night, when poor Elena&rsquo;s marriage was made known, when I was sitting
      on your bed talking to you? Do you remember I asked you, &ldquo;Will there ever
      be men among us?&rdquo; and you answered &ldquo;There will be.&rdquo; O primeval force! And
      now from here in &ldquo;my poetic distance,&rdquo; I will ask you again: &ldquo;What do you
      say, Uvar Ivanovitch, will there be?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers and fixed his enigmatical stare
      into the far distance.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
